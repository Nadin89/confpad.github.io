      You may have heard the quote, "Good artists copy, great artists steal." Ember's origins were inspired by Cocoa. Ember has taken many cues from Rails, the biggest coming in the form of strong framework conventions. In 1.13, Ember's rendering engine was rewritten based on concepts pioneered by React. Instead of writing their own cli from the ground up, Angular has embraced ember-cli. Let's examine past and future benefits of sharing ideas, and what it means for our favorite framework and our industry as a whole.

      What's in an Ember -select- element? For a long time, the answer was two-way data binding, observers, and an obscured DOM, along with the challenges and bugs that went with it. Today, we can move beyond the ((view “select”)) helper and render this common UI element using native DOM and one-way data flow. Through the lens of the select element, both as standalone code and a re-usable component, we’ll learn how and why to use good Ember patterns like data-down, actions up (DDAU), plus some handy new Ember features like closure actions and the mut and ((get)) helpers.

      You may have seen apps like Slack, Visual Studio Code, or Docker's Kitematic: desktop applications written using Node.js and Chromium. You might be hoping to build something similar. Electron was originally built for the Atom editor, and enables developers to build beautiful cross-platform apps using the JavaScript we all love. When combined with Ember, you're looking at a fantastic desktop app development framework. Ember and Electron are a match made in heaven, and this talk will teach you all you need to know to get started building desktop apps with Ember.

      "I’ve always been a backend guy. I love Ruby. Keep things simple. Oh no, not another JavaScript framework..." This was me a year ago. Now I don't feel like this anymore. Matter of fact, the other day I caught myself saying: "I can do everything in Ember!" In this talk, I will narrate the journey that turned a hardened Ruby Engineer into an Ember enthusiast. I will recount how I escaped from the "New to Ember" pits of despair, how I fought in the "Upgrade Wars" and ultimately how it changed my mind about all software development. As I learned Ember, I learned to love Ember.

      It is possible to create performant mobile applications with Ember and Cordova, and to achieve this with your existing Ember application. But most peoples first hybrid experience is seeing serious performance issues and stop ("It doesn’t feel native"). This talk will serve beginner and intermediate Ember developers looking to extend their application to mobile. It will touch on both the best tools in the Ember ecosystem, and best practices for optimization and performance.

      Creating a living design system is essential to developing a cohesive experience for users over the lifetime of a product. Ember tooling and conventions make this easier than you might expect. By organizing your application functionality into Ember components, you can easily build a living style guide to showcase key features, design patterns, and user interactions. This fashion of style guide driven development enables a rapid implementation and feedback cycle, a comprehensive overview of key features, and the blissful feeling of providing order in a chaotic world.

      In low level languages, primitives exist for memory management. Despite the C-like syntax, JavaScript is garbage collected, causing many front end developers to feel it does a great job of memory management for us. But how does it actually work and does it work how we think it does? This session will discuss memory management in JavaScript (compared to other languages) and what is really going on behind your browser. Using an Ember.js application, we will also discuss best practices to optimize our code, how JavaScript and Ember optimizes for us, and ways we can address common pain points.

      Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. But I don't mean the five stages of grief—I'm talking about the five stages of debugging your first Ember app! Learning how to navigate the building blocks of Ember can be difficult, but the even trickier thing is knowing where to start debugging while you're still learning the framework. One approach that I use is to put myself into my code's shoes. In this talk, we'll connect with our objects to understand what's going on under the hood. Let's jump over some common first-time Ember hurdles together by debugging our code — with empathy.

      As the tooling ecosystem continues to evolve, developers nowadays can easily scaffold out a new Ember app and start being productive right away, without ever thinking of all the intricacies that go on behind a typical build command. But there comes a time when manipulating trees or nodes in Broccoli may be required to support a custom project architecture, or you may find yourself having to extend the build for specialized environments through addons. Whether you face any one of those scenarios, or you simply want to know more of what goes on behind the curtain, this talk is for you.

      Whether you know it or not, you're building a distributed system. This becomes painfully obvious when taking Ember apps into the developing world. Flaky network connections pose real challenges for developers building stateful applications in the browser. This talk is about my trials and tribulations taking Ember offline in Africa. We’ll look at the tools necessary to venture offline, how they apply to Ember specifically, and a little bit of theory to drive home the hard facts about how much fun you’ll have building a distributed system!

One team chooses a framework, refactors behind the scenes, ships new features and one day have a shiny, modern code base. The other rewrites it all, from scratch, with sprinkles of JavaScript. How did these two teams fare? In this talk we'll find out. Spoiler alert... both teams are happily using Ember today.

      Ember is generally used to build ambitious web applications, but what about ambitious web games starring your cat? In this talk, I'll go over how to use Ember to build, organize, and deploy HTML5-canvas based games. Using Ember to develop games shares the same benefits of using Ember to develop applications—both the toolchain and the conventions alleviate decision fatigue. For example, route-driven paths are great at handling levels, Liquid Fire provides lovely transitions for menus, and adapters provide a standard way to connect to backends for saving high scores.

      With the release of Ember 2.0, many best practices established in the 1.x series are unfortunately no longer relevant. Lessons learnt from the React and Flux communities can help guide the path toward The Ember Way, with "Data Down, Actions Up" being one of the core philosophies. In this beginner-friendly talk, we'll discuss patterns and anti-patterns for bringing Ember applications into the 2.x paradigm, and discover how ideas from Functional Programming and game rendering engines can inform us. We will also look at the roads ahead to see what future versions of Ember will bring.

      Immutability. It may sound like an ominous something from the far-off galaxy of math, but in practice, it's one of the most pragmatic tools for thinking about UI. In this talk we'll explore the problems that an immutable style solves, and how you can use it as a thought-tool to both design and implement more powerful and composable components. Throughout we'll see just how deeply Ember supports this mode of thought at every step of the way.

This talk will share my experience migrating an existing application to Ember part after part. I'll share tips for how to avoid the unpopular "Big Bang rewrite" (minimizing the costs of adoption), and discuss the integration story and loose coupling of Ember.

In order to achieve this, it is critical to establish an integrated workflow with all team members. In this talk, a designer and a developer who worked together on various Ember projects will present an effective way of handling these challenges. Three levels of documentation will be presented: A living styleguide for designers, a component guide for designers & developers and a JavaScript documentation for developers.
