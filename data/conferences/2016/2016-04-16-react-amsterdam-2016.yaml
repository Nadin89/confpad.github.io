      Martijn Walraven, Meteor, Amsterdam on Building Reactive GraphQL Apps With Apollo.In this talk, I’ll introduce our efforts to design a reactive system to automatically re-run GraphQL queries when the underlying data changes. You will see how to make the collaborative parts of your app update in real time with little extra code, how to integrate with a SQL database or REST API, and how this works in concert with GraphQL’s best features to simplify your app’s data management while being predictable and maintainable.

      Johannes Stein, freelancer, Berlin on React For Game Development.Using React for game development may not seem like an obvious choice at first. With React itself being compared to the Doom 3 game engine at F8 2014, we may not find ourselves in such a bad spot. We will take a look at how games are usually structured. Then we will examine different concepts in game development such as the entity-component pattern, object pools, and how we can implement them in React. At the end, we'll put it all together into a React-powered game.

That means handing them tools that are fast and easy to work with. Last year we started building new tooling using React. How did we come to this decision and how does it suit a fast growing, dynamic organisation? In this talk I will take you on a trip through the research and decision making that was part of coming to our current development stack.

      Michel Weststrate, Mendix, Rotterdam on State Management is Easy State is the heart of each application and there is no quicker way to create buggy, unmanageable applications then by producing inconsistent state. Hence many state management solutions try to restrict the ways in which you can modify state, for example by making state immutable. But this introduces new problems; data needs to be normalised, referential integrity can no longer be guaranteed and it becomes next to impossible to use powerful concepts like prototypes.At Mendix these restrictions where unacceptable and so MobX was born. MobX makes state management simple again by addressing the root issue: it makes it impossible to produce an inconsistent state. This makes state management simple and scalable again.

      Alexey Kureev from Publitas, Amsterdam, and Mike Grabowski from Callstack.io, Wroclaw, on Solving a Tooling Problem For React Native.Unfortunately, React Native, being open-sourced last year, still suffers from the lack of great unified tooling. Managing native dependencies, adding custom fonts, just to name few, are the most common things that require you to know a lot of Objective-C and Java. This talk addresses to solve React Native tooling problems.
