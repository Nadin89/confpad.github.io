      "Webpack is one of the most depended on packages for front-end web development. With over 15 million monthly downloads on npm, it has been called the LLVM of the web and taken the JavaScript ecosystem by storm. However, few understand how webpack actually works and how to leverage some of its most powerful features: Custom Plugins! Join me as I walk you through the internal architecture of webpack, and show you how you can extend, implement, or modify any piece of it! Join me as we unravel the mystery behind webpack together!"

      The overall amount of data that our servers have to handle continue to grow every year, as servers need to handle more and more traffic. As such, event sourcing patterns become more useful to handle the load. In this talk, I would like to talk about the different architecture patterns to implement event sourcing in your Node.js server and what architecture can fit every case.

      One of the unique thing about the web is that no one owns the platform. There are multiple runtime environments available from different browser vendors, and new features are being added every day by different organizations. In this talk, we’ll look at how web platform features are proposed, developed, and tested. We’ll go over what kind of systems are in place to coordinate a massively distributed engineering project, and why you should get involved!

      The stream-oriented architectures are still very rare in the node.js world. While reactive programming becomes a first-class citizen in the front-end applications, we don’t have too many materials on how to apply some of these concepts in our server-side apps. In this talk, Kamil will show you Nest framework as well as introduce you to the world of event-driven systems, CQRS, and Event Sourcing concepts (and how to really take advantage of them).

      Did you ever feel like monkey patching your UI component? Adding too many if/else, handling a lot of complexity or hacking several non-desired side effects. Did you ever have a problem with double-clicking an async button? Fetching multiple times the same resource in a row? Did you have problems translating UX interfaces and mock-ups into your applications scenes? All this kind of problems can be properly fixed by applying a different point of view. An architecture based upon Mealy state machines. Also known as finite state machines or automatas. These machines are deterministic, pure and idempotents. Opening a new set of possibilities from predictable components to autogenerated tests. Let’s take a look at this new paradigm for UI components. You’ll discover a better and cleaner world 😉

    description: |-
      Today we have the ability to write fully Functional-Reactive code in JavaScript, using RxJS. However, in our day-to-day life we often use RxJS alongside other libraries and patterns that make our life easier, but also distance us from pure Functional-Reactive Programming (FRP). What would an app that has been written completely in RxJS, and in-line with the principles of FRP, look like? In this talk we will examine such an app, and use it to understand what truly functional-reactive code in JavaScript looks like, and what are the principles that underlie it.

      "We start with a use case: why would you even want to move to a microfrontends architecture? You’ll learn the motivation, core concepts and principles behind microservices, how they can help your frontend team work more efficiently, and the tradeoffs that are normally involved when you try to apply them to single-page applications. Luckily, Docker and Kubernetes can alleviate a lot of these issues, and we’ll walk through a minimal but concrete example of building a microfrontends architecture with these tools on your local machine. Finally, you’ll see how you could migrate gradually and what it takes to bring this architecture to production. No previous knowledge of Docker or Kubernetes is required."

      State management is a very important topic that brings a lot of new concepts and complexity in an application’s architecture. Instead of focusing only on the implementation details of a specific lib, this talk will explain several beneficial principles of state management at a high level. Based on this knowledge you will not only be able to understand patterns like FLUX and REDUX but also get the knowledge to compare specific libraries like ngRx, ngxs, akita, redux-observable.

      "The advent of the cloud disrupted the software stack. The shift from the LAMP era to the cloud resulted in the shift of the software status quo. JavaScript is the biggest piece of the new, post-LAMP pie. It’s not only a front-end scripting language, but a software stack game changer that is equally powerful for both the front-end and back-end. The aim of this talk is to show how Javascript is one of the major platforms that is shaking up the stack landscape. The first half of the talk will cover the key drivers of the shift of the software status quo, touching upon the areas of deployment, integration, scalability, customization, and, distributed systems architecture. The second half will show the difference between stacks that once upon a time were more varied between client and server, due to JavaScript is now more fluid and homogeneous, with numerous frameworks like Koa, Meteor, React, and, Angular. The talk will be concluded by sharing resources with the attendees as migrations from the LAMP stack is as much a technical change as it is a cultural one. Required knowledge: Basics of Cloud computing, LAMP stack, Distributed Systems, and, JavaScript."

      "How do you scale your codebase? We have more than 100 apps, 200 developers in 5 different time zones and more than 1 million lines of code in our frontend repository. With the codebase that big it’s vitally important to have shared patterns, principles and standards and it’s even more important to make sure everyone actually follows those standards. Learn about the architecture, patterns and technologies that Atlassian has developed to scale frontend development of it’s largest and most popular product: Jira, and lessons learned on that journey. No special knowledge is required, but familiarity and some experience with modern frontend tech stack and ecosystem would help you to get the most out of this talk."

      Web Development is exciting nowadays! We get new innovative technologies on a regular basis. While this is awesome it can also be overwhelming, especially when you have to maintain a product for the long term. Web Components and Micro Apps provide a remedy for this dilemma. They allow for decomposing a big solution into small self-contained parts that can be maintained by different teams using the best technology for the requirements in question. Come to this session and find out how this idea helps with writing applications that can evolve over a decade and more. Let’s peacefully unite the best technologies for the different parts of our big enterprise applications!

      The single-threaded nature of JavaScript can make handling lots of data or complex processing in your web application difficult to balance with providing a good user experience. Web Workers promise to help us find that balance and let us build fast and responsive applications even when doing heavy work, but the APIs for working with them leave much to be desired. In this talk, we’ll explore useful patterns for making Web Workers easier to work with and highlight effective ways to communicate between workers, handle complex data processing off the main thread, and test and debug them.

      We are all working towards one single goal. To create a best user experience. But most of the time we are wrong about what we think is good for the user. We usually have no idea if a feature is useful to the user until it is used by the customers. My talk is about letting the users help you understand what they need and if a particular feature is really useful for the users by using the technique of A/B testing. We are constantly running A/B tests to improve the customer experience by measuring the business metrics. Attend my talk to find out how to run A/B tests in your company at scale and what it takes to build the optimal tests.
