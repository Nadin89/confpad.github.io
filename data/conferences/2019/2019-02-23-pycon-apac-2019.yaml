    "PyCon APAC is a volunteer-run, not-for-profit annual conference centered around the Python Programming language. The goal of the conference is to provide a venue where the Python programming language and surrounding technologies can be explored, discussed and exercised. PyCon APAC is the regional counterpart of PyCon in Asia-Pacific. It is hosted in one (1) of the following countries every year: Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, South Korea, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Japan, Taiwan, India and Bangladesh. This 2019, PyCon APAC will be hosted in the Philippines for the very first time. Learn something new, teach something new, find opportunities, build cool things, make friends, geek out! Come celebrate and enjoy this event with us! "

      As algorithms get more and more complex (i.e. Ensemble models - XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks), it becomes harder to explain the predictions they make. These “Black Box” models may produce more accurate results but may in fact hard to operationalize in the real world as it gets harder and harder to explain to business decision makers how a model came up with the prediction. In certain cases such as in credit scoring model interpretability is crucial particularly for regulatory compliance. This talk will highlight certain Python tools and libraries such as LIME, ELI5 and Skater, that would allow data scientists to finally be able to explain how their models came up with its predictions.

      "A beginner-friendly workshop about programming in Python and Django for women. There will be dedicated coaches who will guide you during the workshop. The ratio is 1 coach: 3-5 participants More info: https://tutorial.djangogirls.org Before the workshop we ask attendees to read a first chapter "How the Internet works". You will also need to: 1. Install the following: - Python3 - Virtualenv - Pip - Django - Code Editor (Gedit or Sublime Text 3) - Git 2. Create a PythonAnywhere Account It's ideal to finish the installations before the workshop so you can have a better coding experience during the workshop. Installing prerequisites and setting up your environment can be a challenge, especially if you've never done this before; many things depend on your operating system, and sometimes the process isn't so smooth. But don't worry, your coach will be there to help you! Just be aware that the installation might take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours, so have patience and keep smiling! :)"

      High unit-test coverage is great, but it cannot effectively find bugs triggered by interactions between multiple features. Since it is not scalable to write tests for all possible interactions, we turn to property-based testing - an approach where we *generate* tests instead of *writing* them. Property-based testing (PBT) is a random-testing approach that first became popular in the Haskell community as QuickCheck. It works by generating random examples to find minimal counterexamples to a pattern or law that ought to always hold true. PBT is especially useful in testing edge cases and interactions between multiple features, particularly in stateful systems. This talk introduces the principles of PBT along with its history and success stories. We then illustrate PBT patterns and examples in Python using Hypothesis. Finally, we see how it fits in with TDD and integration testing.

      Labeled Training Datasets or off-the-shelf tools for labeling training datasets for Sentiment Classification are readily available for English and other major languages. For Tagalog and other Filipino languages, however, this is rarely the case. I developed a novel technique that essentially transfers the knowledge of the labeled training dataset on one language (English) into Tagalog and other Filipino languages. This thus enables one to develop Neural Network Sentiment Classification models on several Filipino languages, leveraging on the availability of large amounts of training data on the English language. This is a better approach than manually labeling data on Filipino languages, as it would take too many resources, and Neural Networks need huge amounts of training data in order to be effective.

      "Machine Learning is probably the most important development in our industry (and possibly our civilisation!). Previously restricted to math geniuses with access to supercomputers and massive data centres, machine learning tools are increasingly available as web services which are easily consumed from more traditional web applications. Python has become the lingua franca of machine learning, so Python developers are well placed to take advantage of the next wave of application development. This talk outlines the various machine learning platforms and provides a set of practical examples that demonstrate how Python developers can start taking advantage of artificial intelligence in their own applications. The intended audience is pretty wide: web developers, students, data scientists should all come away with a set of ideas and tools for implementing machine learning without needing a degree in artificial intelligence!"

      One major challenge in fighting poverty today is the lack of reliable socioeconomic data, which is highly expensive, time-consuming, and labour-intensive to collect through ground surveys. We tackled this problem by using a combination of machine learning, satellite imagery, nighttime lights, and various alternative data sources as a low-cost and robust way to provide reliable estimates of poverty during periods or in areas without sufficient census data. Thinking Machines' team of ML researchers including Issa Tingzon, Ardie Orden, and Kevin Go will present the research methodology and results.

      "Slow applications are no fun. Application performance monitoring (APM) makes tracking down issues problems much easier. But which tools should you use? With the release of Elastic APM, there’s a new option. Language server and Python client is fully open source so you can get started with any app. Elastic’s APM was released some time ago, so it’s a very fresh option for tracing performance problems in Python applications (and other runtimes as well). The basic platform is free so it should be a welcome change for Go developers used to spending huge bills on comparable hosted platforms. It’s useful out of the box for tracing basics on web requests including  : -Request details  - Response time percentiles - Transaction timelines  - Application errors and stack traces  - Individual code lines  - Distributed Tracing It can also be used to track any custom span in any Go application to find out where time is being lost and users are being slowed down. Aravind is passionate about evangelizing technology, meeting developers and helping in solving their problems. He is a backend developer and has seven years of development experience. Currently, he works at Elastic as Developer Advocate and looks after the Developer Relation function of India. Previously, He worked at McAfee Antivirus as a Sr. Software Engineer in Cloud Security Domain. He has a deep interest in Search, Machine Learning, Security Incident Analysis, and IoT tech. In his free time, he plays around Raspi or an Arduino."

      Do you already use our beloved micro-framework Flask but have a problem with the speed and scalability? We hear a lot of buzz with the new fancy asynchronous Python programming using async/await keyword to make our Python code run faster. But really how async works are still not spread well and the majority of Python programmer still not familiar using async/await keyword. In this talks, because Flask is not intended to support async (yet), we are will explore Quart, the Python ASGI web microframework. It is intended to provide the easiest way to use asyncio functionality in a web context, especially with existing Flask apps. This is possible as the Quart API is a superset of the Flask API. So you can instantly migrate your Flask app easily!
