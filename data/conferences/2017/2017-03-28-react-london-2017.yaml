      JavaScript developers are spending soooo much time formatting their code and even more in back and forth in code review fixing small nits. It turns out that machines are really good at doing this kind of tasks. Christopher will walk us through the technical and people challenges of bringing a JavaScript code formatter to reality.

    description: |-
      Combining ideas from both Redux and CRDT, Logux is a new tool which replaces AJAX with real-time data in applications, synchronising action logs between the client and server while also providing an offline mode. This approach could significantly simplify application code and bring plug&play support for live updates and offline editing.

      Bundling JavaScript nowadays is trivial. But what if you need to do it 10,000 times a day to thousands of users, with sourcemaps, served directly to the browser in under 2 seconds? Oliver will show us how they did this at Qubit.

      React is capable of rendering to more environments than the browser. React is really two separate pieces: core and renderers. ReactDOM, ReactNative, ReactVR are but a few renderers in existence. With the Fiber reconciler rewrite comes an official renderer API. Dustan will look at a number of renderers that already exist and implement a React renderer of his own!
