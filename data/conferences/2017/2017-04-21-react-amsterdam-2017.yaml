    React Amsterdam is a full day two-track conference on all things React, gathering Front End developers across the globe in the tech heart of Europe. React Amsterdam is a heir to the biggest React community in BeNeLux and we have our priorities straight: only the highest quality content with careful balance of practical and visionary talks. React Amsterdam 2017 will take place in the Kromhouthal - former shipbuilding factory at a waterfront of Amsterdam City center.

      Max Stoiber, Co-founder and CTO of Space Program (Spectrum) React popularized a new way of building user interfaces â€“ components. By splitting our app into small, digestible parts the system as a whole becomes a lot easier to understand. CSS was made in an era where documents were the height of the web. It doesn't fit easily into component-based systems, making styling one of the pain points of building React applications. What if we took the best of JavaScript and the best of CSS, and combined them together to create the ultimate solution? Glen Maddern (CSS Modules co-creator) and I sat down and starting thinking about styling in this new paradigm. Let's talk about what we thought about and why we arrived where we did â€“ ðŸ’… styled-components.

      Stefano Masini, Full-stack Developer at Balsamiq.At Balsamiq we are rolling out our new web-app to production. A real-world application with real-time collaboration, built using Relay, Redux, node.js, Redis, etc., running on AWS using Convox. Even at small/medium scale, if you're serious about building a good product you will eventually have to build a complex stack. I will share a few lessons learned in the process: how to structure the code, implement reactivity, writing tests.

Let's go through some ways you can give your app the ability to notify you of these bugs before your users do using React and Redux. Start pushing bugs to prod responsibly.

Especially with ReactVR there is no reason for that anymore. The talk kicks off with the basics of WebVR, shows how to build and navigate rooms using panos in ReactVR. Next it shows how to create a couple 3D meshes and how put together a small world using them.

      Michel Weststrate, Full-stack Lead Developer at Mendix."Reactive programming" still sounds scary to many developers. As if it is an elevated way of thinking, only accessible to the chosen few. Nothing is less true! It is the most natural way to look at programming problems. You just might not realize it yet! In this talk, Michel will demonstrate that many complex UI problems, such as form validation and routing, can all be seen as '*actions* that change *facts* which leads to *reactions*'. And as soon as we start distinguishing those concepts in our applications; our code will become more declarative, more concise and less imperative.

      Forbes Lindesay, Software Engineer at Facebook.Adding type checking to your code can be a frustrating experience at first. In this talk, Forbes will help you through that initial stage by identifying some of the problems you're likely to experience and giving you the tools to work through them. We'll cover adding types to code that initially looks too dynamic to type, adding runtime type checking (and whether that's a good idea) and finally, how you publish your type checked modules to npm.

Get ready to get your app to the next level when you learn how to handle these edge cases.

      Mike Grabowski, CTO at Callstack.io.React Native opens up the world of mobile development for many of us, front-end engineers. It not only allows us to use technologies we know already, like React, to provide first-class native experience to our users, but also to support many platforms, like Android and iOS at once, from within the same codebase.This talk will explore various patterns that turned to be useful over the course of few projects I did. It will also demonstrate techniques that can be used to write truly universal apps, ie. ones that share core across web, native and more.

Apparently handling touch and gestures is quite tricky as it often needs to interact with the application code which runs asynchronously in the javascript VM. This talk is going to be about how the gesture system has been designed and implemented in React Native and how to use it to stay out of trouble.

      Kurtis Kemple, Technology Lead at Major League Soccer.When you start out on React Native project, there is a certain sense of awe as the package manager delivers the first bundle to the simulator. You quickly add some hello world text and maybe even a Pokemon image. Things are really starting to look upâ€¦ And then you need to add another view and you realize that you need to navigate somewhere. So you check out the React Native Docs and are quickly greeted by IOSTabBar, Navigation, and NavigationExperimental modules. With so many different options in the core codebase you realize that itâ€™s still a bit of an unsolved problem. Now youâ€™re looking at 3rd party integrationsâ€¦ and you start to wonder, just how should you implement navigation? This talk will outline the different approaches to navigation available in React Native and in the RN eco-system, and the proâ€™s and conâ€™s of each solution.

With a wrong workflow linting can be really a pain and will slow you and your team down. With a proper setup though, it can save you hours of manual work reformatting the code and reducing the code-review overhead.
