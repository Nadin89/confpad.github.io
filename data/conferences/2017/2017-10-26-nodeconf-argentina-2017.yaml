      JS, and, stands to reason, Node, are starting to turn up in places we didn't think possible as little as 3 years ago. From small JS engines running on tiny microcontrollers, to technologies moving to embrace the web, we'll take a look at the odd nooks and crannies that JS has worked its way into, and discuss what this means for the future of Node.

      The NYC Space/Time Directory is a project of The New York Public Library which turns historical maps, street photos, city directories and other geographic sources from the Library's collection into a digital time-travel service for New York City. How did my street look in the 1920s? Who lived on 150 Bowery in 1850? Are there maps of Long Island City in 1900? The NYC Space/Time Directory will make answering questions like this easier, using open data, search APIs, data visualizations, and crowdsourcing tools.

      Virtual reality enables the creation of powerful immersive experiences for games, environments, and content display, but the expensive headsets and complicated frameworks needed to create, distribute, and access VR are anything but appealing to the web developer —or the masses—. But worry not, for JavaScript comes to the rescue!! WebVR is the developing open standard that makes it possible to create and experience VR using just a browser. Its goal, to make VR experiences accessible for everyone, regardless of which device they might have. All that’s required is a cell phone (or headset), a browser, and JavaScript. In this talk, we'll go through the state of WebVR, its current and future plans, technical support, and show a few entertaining use cases. We will introduce A-frame as a declarative, entity-component based framework for creating awesome and compelling experiences with JS, and finish by demoing a couple of interactive WebVR experiences for the audience to participate in.

      In the past few years, peer-to-peer distributed infrastructure has become more viable in Node.js. WebTorrent, for example, opened up the possibility for streaming BitTorrent files in the browser, where every person who watched a video would be contributing a piece of their bandwidth to improve speed for everyone else watching the video. However, this kind of technology goes far beyond streaming videos. In this talk, I introduce Dat, a peer-to-peer data sharing protocol that updates data over time. This means that we can build websites, applications, and collaborate on documents in a way that is resilient against censorship and Internet shutdown. Audience members will be able to understand the Dat protocol, how it works, and how to build a website using Dat.

      Tools like Babel, ESlint, JScodeshift, Prettier all seem to work magically for us. Since they relate to subjects such as "compilers" and "parsers", we never even dare to look inside and understand what they do. How do they work? We'll see the fundamental piece of the puzzle, the Abstract Syntax Tree, or AST. What it is, what it is for, and how can we use it to ease our work and make us more productive while keeping our code optimized, or even do crazy things we never thought of. After this talk you'll no longer be afraid of the AST, and you'll know enough to go and write your own plugins!

      You constantly read 'you shouldn't block the event loop' around the node community. How do you know if/when it's blocked? Can you assess the impact of a block spike? Understanding how every operation affects the event loop marks the difference in the reliability and the performance of any application. We will look at finding and solving not-so-obvious examples such database queries, memory leaks, GC pauses, 3rd party modules.

      No matter your experience in JS, you have probably came across the Array#sort method at some point. Do you remember the first time you tried sorting numbers? You were probably astonished that the sort method does not sort things out quite as we might expect. Believe it or not, there is actually much more going on than meets the eye! Let’s get our computer science hat on and explore some useful sorting algorithms currently implemented by JS engines used by Node such as Chrome's V8 and Microsoft's Chakra. As a developer, learning how these algorithms work, why and when to use them will help you create more performant and consistent applications!

      This is a comparison of different methods for performing asynchronous control flow in JavaScript, specifically Callbacks, Promises, Generators / Yields (ES2015), and Async / Await (ES2016). We will explore a simple code example as it applies to each of these different "phases" of asynchronous control flow. Finally we'll examine how Async functions are just Promises under the hood and that the two are interoperable.

      Being a Node programmer means creeping ever-closer to a state of epic project dependencies. Is it worth letting go of your favourite packages? Michelle road-tested a bunch of lightweight alternatives to popular Node modules so you don’t have to, and built some cute interactive applications along the way. She’ll be sharing strategies for reducing the size of your node_modules directory, and pondering how to evaluate the right package for a project (beyond the number of stars on GitHub).

      "Node.js is an event-based platform. This means that everything that happens in Node is the reaction to an event. A transaction passing through Node traverses a cascade of callbacks. Abstracted away from the developer, this is all handled by a library called libuv which provides a mechanism called an event loop. This event loop is maybe the most misunderstood concept of the platform, yet understanding it is vital to really grasp what Node.js is all about. In this talk I will cover the learnings from digging into the event loop to get some actionable performance metrics out of it."

      Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence are becoming ubiquitous in websites, chatbots and mobile apps. While Node.js may not be the language of choice for building and training ML models, it is an excellent option for building the user-facing server layer that brings ML product to life. In this talk learn about the ways that Node and ML can work together whether it’s through running ML models in the browser (using WebAssembly and WebGPU) or writing a node server for an ML chatbot. She’ll show you how to take a pre-trained ML model built on any library (e.g. TensorFlow, Torch) and any language (python, lua), and build and deploy a node server for a Facebook messenger bot that interfaces with the model.

      Node.js add-ons allow native code to be run from the Node.js runtime. In this talk, Athan will discuss how to utilize native add-ons for high performance numeric computing and machine learning in Node.js applications. He will first provide an overview of add-ons and their associated toolchain. Next, he will walk through an example which involves compiling basic linear algebra subroutines (BLAS), a suite of libraries which are a core foundation of most modern numeric computing environments, as native add-ons. While Node.js add-ons are oriented toward C and C++, he will show how to extend compilation support to Fortran libraries in order to maximize computational performance. Throughout the talk, Athan will offer lessons learned and other insights gained while writing add-ons and demonstrate why Node.js is an excellent environment for high performance numeric computing and machine learning.

      There are a number of things you need to know after your service goes to Production. The most simple and important one: is it working? And if it's not, where is the problem? Since these questions apply to all the services in your ecosystem and how they interact with each other, you might want to know this quickly and easily. But, more importantly, you want to design & implement this in a simple and secure way. In this talk, I'm going to talk about real-life examples that made us realize why this is important. And some of the tools we are using (and building) to know this real-time.
