      Ahh… CSS and performance. Two of my favourite things! But how well do they play together? It depends… In this very matter-of-fact talk, we’ll be looking at all of the different ways CSS can make our websites faster or slower. From the common and perhaps more obvious, to the unusual and obscure ways in which CSS can impact performance for better or worse.

      The days that assistive technology like screen readers just scrape the DOM to present the content of a web page are long gone. These days, there are sophisticated APIs that browsers and assistive technologies use to communicate. A key part in this communication is the accessibility tree, the representation of your web page that can be queried by assistive technology. We’ll explore this tree and see how you can use it to quickly get an idea how assistive technology will present your web page. Important accessibility concepts will be explained along the way.

      Progressive web applications are the new hip and all the cool kids are on board. They are slowly becoming an industry standard for building web applications. With reliability, speed and immersive user experience in mind, PWAs help you reach a broader audience. But what are the gotchas? Let's explore some of the limitations we might encounter compared to native applications. Which traditionally native features are now available for PWAs to use and which are in development? All browsers are on the same page, supporting features like Service Workers is key but which are differences in API implementation and what bugs should we be aware of? After this session you'll walk away with a clear idea on which is the current state of PWAs, its limitations as well as its strengths.

      We are rapidly moving into a world where apps, products, services, etc. are all connected. At the same time, new interface and interaction technologies such as AR, voice UI and conversational UI become more and more accessible. How do we design for this new way of looking at user-product interaction? Where is the value for users, customers, and businesses? Philips is operating in this domain, and in this talk we will take a look some cases that illustrate how Philips, and in particular it’s design department, address the challenges that come with this evolving tech landscape. Briefly some of the conceptual projects and methodologies from Philips Design will be presented, before zooming in on the domain of sleep solutions. Some best practises will be shared, as well as several unaddressed challenges, experiments and new ways of exploring product-service ecosystems through lenses of UX design, Service Design and value creation.

      Imposter syndrome is a term often used to explain feelings of incompetence or a lack of confidence when one is surrounded by a group of peers. In this talk, I make the case that the use of the term 'imposter syndrome' is an inadequate descriptor of pedagogical pathologies in the tech world. Rather than excuse the feelings of inadequacy as a natural aspect of a career in tech, we can access tools that will aid in acquiring new skills and create a more hospitable environment for promoting collaboration in teams and engendering open and supportive communities.

      With the ongoing explosion of conversational interfaces in the form of chatbots and voice assistants, a concomitant revolution is happening in content strategy, design, information architecture, and user experience for conversational experiences. Conversational content throws several wrenches in the web-based content paradigms that have been essential to our current understanding of content, how to design for it, and how to manage it. Just like the wholesale transformation of content from print to web, we are witnessing a similar transition where marketers are increasingly freeing content from the confines of the website. But conversational content is inherently different from web-based content and comes with distinct concerns. For instance, conversational content tends toward single, contained utterances rather than the longform prose found on websites. It is organized differently too, with unidirectional guided flows favored over reference-rich links. From a usability and accessibility standpoint, voice assistants and chatbots pave new opportunities but present puzzling obstacles. In this session, we'll talk about how to handle conversational content, with the help of real case studies in the wild: how to write, model, manage, and organize it; how to design conversational interfaces when your tools are aural, not visual; how to perform usability tests on conversational content; and how to ensure your information architecture works for both web and conversational cases. We'll also talk about content reusability when you don't have the luxury to distinguish two separate channels for content. Here's what we'll cover: * A brief history of zero user interfaces * Web-based versus conversational content * Design: The aural and verbal canvas * Information architecture: Decision flows, not navbars * Content strategy: Constructing conversational content * Content differentiation vs. content harmonization * The curious case of Ask GeorgiaGov * Content auditing: Preparing for an omnichannel content strategy * Handling calls to action and hyperlinks * User experience: Dialogues, not dialogs * Guided decision flows vs. traditional visual interfaces * Aural usability testing with retrospective probing * Epilogue: Conversational content in the omnichannel context This session is intended for content strategists, digital leaders, editorial teams, marketing organizations, architects, designers, and developers who are interested in delivering conversational experiences and the implications of conversational content on issues of design, content strategy, information architecture, and user experience.

      Browser based developer tools have become an indispensable tool for modern front-end web development. New features and changes are being added at a rapid pace, and keeping up with all of the changes is difficult, but well worth it! In this presentation, I’ll walk the attendees through the tricks of the trade of Chrome developer tools, in addition to Firefox and Safari’s developer tools. I’ll walk through common problems and how to solve them including - Integrating DevTools into your modern front-end workflow - Modern front-end debugging techniques using browser-based developer tools - Identifying front-end performance problems (and fixing them!) - Profiling browser rendering issues - Making sure your CSS is resilient to content-based changes - Common add-ins - Using browser based developer tools to remotely debug your smartphone - both Android and iOS - Various tips and tricks that will save you hours in your next project - And best of all, this will all be covered through the use of real-world examples. This presentation will be mostly live real world examples (with a minimum of slides). To get the most out of it, I assume that you have very basic familiarity with browser, and are familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

      Building products for the web means building products for everybody. We spend hours and hours on optimising user flows, tweaking designs and A/B testing the heck out of everything. The problem is that we as developers, product owners and designers often think about the targeted customer under optimal conditions and ignore minorities. In this talk, we will take a look at common problems of the web today and demonstrate how we can make it a more welcoming place.

      The old-school way of building interfaces screen by screen or page by page is slow, full of mistakes and results in a product that is difficult to maintain and takes forever to change. The alternative is style guide driven development - creating an interface as a system of reusable components. Modular flexible design, well organised code and smooth easily controlled process. More and more companies publish their design systems online and talk about advantages of this approach to building interfaces. But being inspired is one thing and knowing how to start working this way is something else. This lecture is a practical guide to styleguide-driven development for projects of any size and any level of maturity: for small startups and huge enterprise systems with years of legacy behind. We shall talk about what style guide driven development means both for the designer and the developer. We will teach you how to approach it gradually and not break your neck and not change your tools and workflow too dramatically. We will point out potential problems and suggest ways to overcome them. You will learn: ● How to organize collaboration process for designers and developers on creating design system; ● How to apply styleguide-driven approach regardless what platform your product is built on; ● How to start getting value not only after the full launch of the design system, but from day one.

      Open source content management systems are made by those who show up. This creates a unique challenge when developing for privacy and data protection, as contributors bring very different cultural and legal approaches to the table. As project contributors, we need to acknowledge those differences, and the issues they create, so that we can provide a better standard of privacy for those who use our CMSes and those who visit the sites made on them. In this session, we will discuss different cultural approaches to privacy, summarise different legal approaches including GDPR, and will also reflect on the impact that open source CMS development can have on privacy across the web. We will take a brief look at recent data protection scandals which have brought these issues to the fore, including those involving open source CMSes. And for a case study, we’ll explore how the WordPress project has approached improving privacy standards in advance of GDPR.

      Until 2010 we created fixed websites. The only issue was IE. From 2010 with responsive design that first appeared as a trend, nowadays with so many devices is a standard, we have new challenges: to create not just good user experience but a great one. Can we make better design system to bulid websites? Yes! Marija will talk about the concept of atomic design in responsive design and its elements: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates and pages with an example, useful tips and her working process. Why should you use atomic design and is it the future of webdesign? Where does she see Atomic design in 1 to 2 years? We are creating the systems of fragments that will connect to create components, modules and templates that we can reuse all over again, plus of course what the client wants plus your creativity.

      CSS is magical. It's magical because of the one part that everyone complains about, the one part that it has become popular to try and remove - the cascade! This talk will will show how the cascade isn't just about specificity and overriding properties. The cascade is fractal, existing at every level of CSS. It's about how we write CSS that works for everybody. It's about writing CSS that copes with the past and with the future. It's about writing CSS that's robust and will work on every device. Feature queries, media queries, CSS Grid, and even Houdini are all part of the cascade! As well as practical examples of how the cascade works, this talk will show some of the history of CSS, how it has evolved, and how to make your CSS flexible for the future.

      By the time I'm writing this abstract NPM has 568,191packages. Tomorrow an average of 447 new ones will be published. In this talk, I will not complain about it. Instead, we will study this phenomenon in depth and see what can we learn from JS Fatigue and how to deal with it without headaches. The whole reason for JS Fatigue is not the huge amount of modules we've got available, the real issue is the mindset we have when writing code. With an average of 447 new packages a day and lots of new technologies appearing it seems impossible to keep up with the insane velocity things happen in the JavaScript ecosystem, but actually you don't necessarily need to. In this talk, I won't talk about the language itself and I won't talk about frameworks. I will talk about what how this ended up happening and why we should see it as a positive thing from a software engineering point of view. For a very long time we have been talking about componentization and reusability and now that we've got it we started complaining about it, how did that happen? We will talk about Unix Philosophy, about the current state of open source software development and about our role as software engineers, after all, we're not paid to write code, we are paid to solve problems.

      As my background is in Graphic Design and Interaction Design, I always worked with technology to design digital and print work. During my studies in Interaction Design, I was mostly focused on creating the design and interaction of the projects we worked on, not the technology. As I have been fascinated by generative art and drawing with code for a long time, I started in 2014 to explore how to create art and design with code. Exploring new ways and learning new tools. Due to being a perfectionist and too scared to show my work to anyone, I started a challenge to create and post an artwork every day for a month, this was September 2014. After this, I continued to make and post more and decided to start a new daily make challenge on the first of January 2015, it still continues to this day. For my talk I want to present how I started and what I learn from it. There are many small challenges I create for myself, like a different language or framework I explore, or more design related like using the same shapes or colors. These small challenges bring new focus and explorations. Having this daily big challenge has of course multiple values I can explain. How it makes it easier to explore things in your work, being more in a workflow and giving yourself time to explore. But also the challenges of starting something new and being creative every single day. So in short, a talk about 'Creativity with Code' or 'Making Art with Code Daily'. During the talk I probably will be showing many of my 1000+ daily creations!

      "The front-end moves faster than Drupal, whether Drupal likes it or not" This reference from "The state of the Front-end" session at DrupalCon Amsterdam explains that we need different ways to retrieve content from a Drupal site for an easy integration with new front-end frameworks and other 3rd-party applications. This allows non-experienced front-end developers to start theming Drupal using the tools they are used to, providing at the same time multiple integrations with other platforms through APIs. Currently there is a debate about how to achieve this and what direction Drupal will take in the future. In this workshop there will be explained different approaches to solve common problems and what possible solutions are provided by Drupal and its contributed modules. You can join this discussion, share your thoughts and experiences with others, and help Drupal to go on the right track.

      Optimizing images can drastically decrease the page load time because, on average, 60% of a website’s page weight is made up of them. Responsive Web Design has changed how the web is built and that includes images too, because the aim is to deliver the highest quality image supported and nothing more. So nowadays we have new standard elements and attributes to work with images widely supported by browsers (and polyfills for the rest). This session will go through this new standards reviewing the different options for responsive images. Starting from the basics, like the differences between viewport sizing and Art Direction, to the plan and the implementation. We will also see which solutions gives Drupal out-of-the-box and how to take the most of them with contributed modules to give automated Art Direction for the final user.

      Building a component based library with React for re-use in the real world! How Justlease adapted React in their white-labeled headless setup. A deep dive into setting up a multi themed React environment. Using tools like storybook, flow and styled components to create an abstract layer to serve multiple web and mobile applications. In this talk I will explain what real-life problems we ran into working for a marketing based company and how we solved them by creating a React based component library. We will discuss shortly the issues we ran into and we will take a deep dive into how we solved it with a new development stack.

      The development towards anticipatory experiences is welcome by most since the human brain is not made for the number of choices we have to make on a daily basis. For his Masters Digital Experience Design at Hyper Island, Joel has researched within the field of design and the ethical challenges we face during the development of machine learning-based anticipatory systems. In this meetup, he will guide a discussion around topics like privacy, ownership (of data), level of automation, experience bubble and free will.

      We are not blessed with infinite resources, so when we make things for the web we have to decide what gets done and what doesn't. But what we choose to prioritize isn't always what deserves to be a priority. This talk explores the spurious thinking, the privileges and the prejudices, behind our faulty prioritizations and defends inclusive design as the ultimate priority when building interfaces.
