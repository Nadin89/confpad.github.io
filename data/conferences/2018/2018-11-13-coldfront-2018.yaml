      We talk a lot about how to animate on the web, and what's possible in browsers today, but where is animation heading? In this talk, we'll start with some bleeing edge techniques such as native-like page transitions with client side rendering, but then we'll push it further. The intersection of health and animation with biofeedback sensors, the future of 3d in the browser complete with interviews with people who are writing these specs... this talk will show that in terms of animation on the web, we're just getting started.

      Michael Flarup - on designing for Augmented Reality We thought we could port our existing game to an AR experience. We couldn't. Here's what happened and everything we learned.In this talk I'll take the audience through the journey we went on creating our first AR-only experience. Our game Conduct AR! I'll talk about how many of the assumptions we had going in turned out to be wrong and how we worked to change them in a race to launch alongside iOS 11.It'll be an explosive, entertaining and visual journey into one of the most exciting frontiers in technology today.

      Brent Vatne - on future of Expo and React Native Fabric is a re-implementation of much of the internals of React Native that draws inspiration from the experiences of over three years of production use and turns initial design decisions upside down. In particular, it moves away from a mainly asynchronous bridge between the JavaScript and native runtimes by leveraging the React Fiber architecture. We’ll look at Fabric with a focus on what problems it aims to solve and which will problems will remain.We’ll also discuss the company that I work on, Expo. Expo is an important part of the React Native ecosystem because it builds tools, services, and libraries around React Native core that are increasingly depended on by the community. It removes the native build step required to get started and provides a “Create React App”-style experience. Expo also provides a CodeSandbox style web playground called Snack. A key piece of Expo is the extensive native API wrapper modules that are available out of the box. Up until recently, this package has been monolithic and developers have had to buy into the entire Expo toolchain in order to take advantage of the native modules. We recently re-architected them so React Native users can use as few or as many as they like, and Flutter, Cordova, or even normal native apps can take advantage of them to have a cleaner cross-platform interface for interacting with native APIs.

      It was not until recently that the term AR has been reserved for a small group of developers, researchers and tech enthusiasts. All that changed with a game catching the interest of the general public and the subsequent introduction of Apple's own technology that promises to deliver augmented reality experiences to the masses - ARKit.In this interactive session, we will learn what ARKit is, get a glimpse of what it can do and show you how easy it is to get started with it.

      Like it or not, a huge part of modern web development involves the use of third-party providers: fonts, analytics, ads, tracking, and more all have an impact of performance, and can leave us (or, more worryingly, our visitors) susceptible to performance degradation.In this talk, we’ll take a look at unruly or uninvited (third-)party guests: how to detect them, how to audit them, and how to manage them. We’ll also look at the different tools available to help us stress-test and quantify the overhead these third parties bring, and what that means for users and businesses alike.

      Data visualizations are becoming more common on the web, from visual essays to internal business analytics to features within products. But visualizations and D3.js - the library most commonly used for developing these visualizations - are still considered niche in the front-end ecosystem. The lack of adoption may come from the initial friction developers face when learning D3.js, but with frameworks like React and Vue, that friction can be greatly reduced.In this talk, I'll speak about how React and Vue can make working with D3.js easier, and how to use D3.js with either of the frameworks. Then, I'll show how we can write more complex interactions with less code using D3.js and React.js. I hope this talk will show how fun it is to create data visualizations for the web, and I hope it'll lead to more visualizations on the web

      Vitaly Friedman - on future adventures in front-end You’re a smart cookie. If someone asks you to build a responsive accordion, you’ll figure it out. The same goes for a table. Or a calendar. Or, God forbid, a multi-level-mega-drop-down. But how would you go around slightly more complicated components?What if you had to build a sophisticated car configurator with a real-time updated 3D view? What about an advanced feature comparison table, a music festival schedule, an election map, an airfare booking and check-in, a live world football championship leaderboard and a theatre map seat selection? In this session, we’ll take a microscopic examination of common interface components and problems appearing in responsive user interfaces — and we’ll look into simple art-direction techniques to create unique and memorable experiences.Tighten up your seatbelt! Beware: you will not be able to unlearn what you’ll learn in the session! Ah, one more thing, take the techniques with a grain of salt — we do not take responsibility for sleepless nights and nightmares caused by the content of this session.

      Sara Soueidan - on future of real-world CSS CSS has advanced so much in the last few years and new features were added to it that make our lives as developers easier. But on the other hand some features have been added that are there to provide a better experience for our users as well, as long as we utilize them to do so.In this talk, Sara is going to cover some of the most useful CSS and SVG features, and how they can be used to make more usable products that respond to user's needs and preferences, to create overall more inclusive interfaces.

      Designers and developers can often butt heads. We hail from different backgrounds; we bring different perspectives; we speak different lingo. The level of trust and understanding between designers and developers can make or break a frontend team. And the tools we use can have a remarkable impact on the strength of this relationship.This talk will explore how advancements in design tools have brought designers and developers closer together. We’ll take a look at how specific features in a tool can actually influence design methodologies and practices. We’ll also explore the ramifications of letting developers loose in a design tool. For one team in particular, this has had a profound impact on the team’s culture.Finally, we’ll extrapolate these current trends into the future. Could a mere design tool change our concept of what it means to be a designer or a developer?

      It goes without saying that one of the largest challenges in JavaScipt is handling asynchronicity. Along come Async / Await, a language feature made popular by C#. Developers can now use the keyword await to write code in a synchronous fashion without blocking the main thread. The only catch is that the await keyword needs to be used in an asyncfunction.What if that were not the case? What if await could be used anywhere inside a JavaScript module? This talk follows the adventure of implementing the Top-Level await feature in the JavaScript language. From deep dives into module loading to a high level overview of socializing standards changes, this talk covers the process of what it takes to change the JavaScript language.

      A typical interaction with a device or interface involves touching it. Either you're pressing buttons on a controller, swiping on a touchscreen or clicking on your laptop's trackpad. But what if you could control things without the use of your hands? What if you could use... your thoughts?For the past couple of years, I have been tinkering with a brain sensor and developed an open-source JavaScript framework to allow me (or anyone else) to control interfaces or robots using facial expressions and mental commands. In this talk, I will be sharing what I learnt, showing how it works and talking about the future possibilities of alternative interactions.

      WebRTC has been around for several years allowing native audio and video streaming from a browser without using external plugins. P2P streaming has natural limits on the number of participants and broadcasting to large audiences presents an architectural challenge.In this session we will give a brief introduction to how WebRTC works and what it takes to scale it. Furthermore we will give a demo on how mobile devices can be used as additional audio and video sources.

This way we will not only create more responsible products, but gain additional benefits in the areas of performance, security, privacy and user happiness. This talk will show how to truly care about our users and improve the user experience at the same time. Most importantly, this talk is a guide, a technical inspiration, will question the status quo and help us build for a better web.

Choosing to target VR users can be a big bet, but what if the same immersive content could run on your phone that does in VR? In this talk, Jacob will explore what we’re learning about the web in VR, how to reach more users by uniting 2D and VR, and advances coming down the pipe to WebXR that will take those experiences to the next level.

And what do can we do when technology is not the solution? In this talk, Mina shares reflections from her work in social good space, and explores strategies to take your activism from behind the keyboard and echo chambers out into the real world.
