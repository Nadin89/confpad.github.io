      We live in a competitive world. That competition forces change. It has always forced change. Change is normal. The question is not whether our organisations will change, that’s a given, but can we see this change before it hits us, do we know where we’re heading or are we simply floating aimlessly being carried by a river? It certainly feels that way sometimes. To answer the question we need to understand our landscape, the economic forces at play, the context we operate within and our situational awareness of this. Can we navigate the waters, can we see a storm coming or are we being battered by rocks because we refuse to look?During this talk we will examine the level of situational awareness within business, why it matters and whether we can anticipate and exploit change before it hits us. We look into the changes that are occurring with the development of serverless, why now, what’s important to it, how it will change the way we do business and how this interacts with the API economy. There’s a lot of fuss about serverless and in this session will try to paint a clearer picture or at the very least a map of where it is going.

      Mobx State Tree is a simple and powerful solution to manage your application state, based on MobX. You probably heard about it and maybe you tested it out with an “hello world” project, but... are you using it in production ? Do you know how it scales and how to test it? DAZN is a sports streaming company with millions of users around the world, and we just finished to rewrite entirely the Front End.At the core of our front end architecture we have MobX and MobX State Tree, and I’d like to share with you why we made this decision and how it made our lives easier.Reactive Architecture, Model Composition, Mutability and Immutability are just a small subset of all the features that I’m going to walk you through. Join me to find out why MobX State Tree could be your next best friend!

      It’s easy to just build an app with no real architecture in mind. For the most part, Angular as a framework ensures that you don’t drive off the road. However, as your application grows it becomes more and more apparent that you need to organise your code in a better way. The application state grows and suddenly it’s everywhere and you realise you don’t know anything about anything. This is where NGRX comes in to bring order to the chaos. NGRX ensure that your data flows in one direction and that you always know who did what to your state. Are you curious on what NGRX is and how to get started with its paradigms, libraries and tools? Then this session is for you.

      The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is most famously known for its list of the top ten security risks for websites. After a long wait, the 2017 edition of the list has been released. There have been many changes to the previous editions, including new and refined threats against web applications and APIs alike. We’ll have a look at all entries on that list, what’s new, what has changed, and what security risks a modern web application will face. This applies to both regular web applications and APIs.

      When starting to dabble with Javascript, the biggest challenge for most developers is understanding how to deal with asynchronous development. During this talk, we will cover some of the different ways to handle async programming like callbacks, promises, reactive streams and events. As we cover those, we will also plunge into some of the mechanics of the NodeJs engine, namely the event loop. Developers attending this talk will have a better understanding of asynchronous programming and will have a few new tools to their belt to tackle those issues as they come.

      Redux has created an enormous paradigm shift in web application development. This made redux a standard and best practice to handle data changes in an application.  In this session we will talk about- when and how we should use Redux in a react app. Then we will get familiar with redux core concepts with a real-world application (not in a todo app). Finally, we will discover accidentally that Redux is not very good at asynchronous side effects. This will make prince Redux cry. Then he made a short relationship with Redux-thunk that didn’t last very long. Finally, he will meet his soulmate Redux-Saga. Through a romantic adventure, we will explore redux-saga’s maintainable and testable approach to managing side effects, asynchronous calls (like an AJAX request). Most importantly we will unveil whether Redux and Saga’s relationship creates any side effects or handles them with care.

      You and your team have this great Idea and you have your users using different devices and operating systems to access the same application. Some users are on the Web, some on Mobile some of their Desktop and you also have to worry about what operating system they are on and also have to consider how your application is presented on each device & operating system. What if there was a way to code your app without worrying too much about operating systems/devices/screen sizes and just focusing on getting your idea across to your users regardless. Join me on a journey where I show you how to use Angular, Ionic & the PWA standard to build apps for IOS, Android, Windows, Web, Mac & PC with the same code all using just HTML5.

      For scaffolding files, the Angular CLI leverages the code generator schematics. To customize its behavior, everyone can tweak the used templates and even create new ones. In this session, you will learn how Schematics work and how we can write npm-Packages that provide code generators. You will also see how to modify existing source files, e. g. in order to register a generated component with an existing module. At the end you know everything to automate repetitive coding tasks.

      Microservices have been a topic for years now. Traditional micro services architectures often choose the UI as it’s platform for integrating the services, which often results in small, decoupled backend services, but a tightly coupled, hard to maintain, monolithic frontend application.Micro frontends are the obvious solution to that problem: we take the learnings from the backend to the frontend. We will discuss different micro-frontend approaches, their up- and their downsides.

      JavaScript has enjoyed it’s hipster level fan following for an exceptionally long time now. Over the years, this fanbase has only grown adding more and more functionality to JS with different frameworks. However, every now and then a little birdie tells us how a few of them tried this trending language called TypeScript and how they instantly fell in love with it. This talk will begin with understanding why and how TypeScript came into existence and later go through some basics of writing code in TypeScript. It will also answer a lot of questions about the various mechanics of the working of TypeScript.

      NodeJs is getting more and more popular this days. It has gone through long and painful history of mistakes and learning. Being a great “window” for front-end developers to the “World of back-end” it has improved the overall tech knowledge of those engineers by giving them opportunity to write actual end to end products themselves using familiar approaches. But it is still JavaScript, and that makes most of back-end engineers nauseous, when they see it. With this article series akka suggestions, I would like to make NodeJS APIs look a bit better. As a superset of JavaScript, TypeScript brings proper inheritance principles as well as strong typings which can help as a lot.

      For Philips Hue we use RxJS to control millions of lightbulbs around the world. RxJS offered the right abstractions to allow us to focus on what our code needed to do, therefore less plumbing was needed on how to achieve this. This has reduced the amount of code being developed resulting in less bugs in our cloud infrastructure versus using traditional async methods like promises or callbacks.But using RxJS also has major pitfalls. The learning curve is steep and debugging is difficult. In this talk we will dive into the reasons why debugging RxJS code is complex and show many different options to tackle this problem.

      The core JavaScript language is lacking much of the functionality that other programming languages provide as part of their standard libraries. In this talk, Philipp Burckhardt will introduce stdlib, a collaborative effort that comes with >1500 functions built to address this gap. The functions range from basic utilities to complex statistical models to machine learning and numeric analysis. Usage of stdlib offers several benefits over currently available options from the npm ecosystem: high quality, rigorous, and robust implementations, consistent interfaces, an enterprise-friendly open-source license, extensive documentation, and complete unit-tests. More importantly, stdlib brings much needed functionality for scientific computing and machine learning to JavaScript and Node.js. Modern JavaScript engines bring unmatched performance benefits compared to traditional numeric computing languages such as Python and R, and Node.js Addons and WebAssembly allow building high-performance interfaces to native C/C+ code, thus creating a suitable platform for numeric computation.

      Remember when setting up an auth system was easy? Me neither. From the signup form, the login form, password reset form, and all the validation in between it can easily take weeks if not months to get something basic up and running. Then you have to deal with all the security considerations. No thanks. During this presentation, the attendees will be introduced to OpenID and OAuth.\_ They will learn how to leverage these technologies to create secure applications, but most importantly, they will learn why and how to delegate authorization and authentication so they can focus on their real work and forget about all that security stuff.

      NativeScript has opened up a whole new world to Angular developers: the ability to share code directly between your web and native iOS/Android applications. Which is awesome! But, just because you can share code across multiple platforms, doesn’t mean that you necessarily should. In this talk we’ll first take a look at what NativeScript makes possible from a code sharing perspective. We’ll build a few Angular components and use them both in the browser and on mobile devices. Then we’ll take a step back and look at the same code from a pragmatic, maintenance-oriented perspective. Come for practical tips & tricks on sharing code across multiple development environments.

      PouchDB is an open source JavaScript database, that runs in the browser. It comes with a pretty simple api, is lightweight and supports querying the data in both a MongoDB-way and using map reduce. It’s most outstanding feature might be that supports the CouchDB replication protocol, which allows you setup multi-master-replications between PouchDB in the browser and CouchDB on your servers. This session will give you an introduction into PouchDB, CouchDB and the constraints of architectures that you can build on these technologies.

      What is the ultimate hack of our lives? What is the one thing that we strive to learn the most about? What is the thing that will truly unlock our potential? This talk is a demonstration of an open-source Brain-Computer Interface that is completely developed with JavaScript, from the ground up, using neural networks and signal processing. Armagan hits the stage with a wireless EEG headset, shows how to read signals from the brain in JavaScript using native C++ Node.js modules over USB, and the implementation in Electron. We go into the detail of how this is possible with current JavaScript technologies, Node.js, Electron and Vue. A little bit of signal processing, a little bit of neural networks, and a demo of code and action follows. The beginners will be in awe when they see what they can do with JavaScript, the advanced users will learn a new field of application. The goal is to underline that JavaScript is not only for websites but is actually the coolest thing ever.

      Our job is hard. We build things that does everything from makepeoples lives simpler, to changing the world and also let’s face to make someone else rich. Regardless of which, there are a lot of things we need to care about to hammer out the best possible solution:Architecture, patterns, 3rd party vendors, frameworks, tools, libraries. Did someone say users?Sometimes we lay awake at night wondering if we can save another CPU cycle or wether we tested everything. Then, if we are “lucky enough” to work on the frontend, we have to say goodbye to one framework a week, by 6 months everything we know is almost guaranteed to be obsolete.We spend our career in a hamster wheel of continuous learning and retraining while someone throws tasks or bugs at us. It’s easy to feel stressed out, even though we might love our craft. In all that chaos we need to find our inner voice, what we feel passionate about, what makes us bring our A-game.There are different ways to become awesome, different ways to keep your sanity. Let’s explore what those are and hopefully you will feel inspired enough to look forward to that morning commute.

      The web is asynchronous by design, and it has to be. But, there is a slight problem that asynchronous programming has a slight tendency to make people’s heads explode. And people really don’t like when their heads explode. To get out of the pickle, we need to handle the asynchrony somehow. This talk will explore the reasons for the design of the web, and will try to offer some solutions, from the worst possible to the current state of the art.

      Achieving organisational agility has become one of the most needed, hence desired, goal of most enterprises operating in the digital landscape. There has been a significant growth in the take up of agile approaches specifically in the software industry and beyond. Among these are XP, Scrum, Kanban, Lean, SAFe, LESS and more. DevOps has been one of the latest agile approaches, focusing mainly on collaboration between development and operations through developing technical capabilities for continuous deployment & service delivery. A recent research, carried out by the speaker, suggests sixkey themes to a DevOps approach. These are as follows: Cultural change; Continuous integration, delivery & deployment; Tooling & cloud automation; Accepting DevOps as part of the business strategy; Problems solved together; Everyone benefits from DevOps. Based on these themes, the purpose of this talk is to explain why DevOps is seen as a cultural change rather than a pure technological change. This allows me to propose a new DevOps model building on the existing principles of promoting collaboration and transparency between teams through a set of technological practices, such as common tooling andautomation, continuous integration and deployment to support end-to- end fast delivery of value. The new framework named ‘CALMSLI DevOps Model’, based on the already existing CALMS model (by Edwards and Humble), will be explained with the aim of offering a strategic framework underpinned by seven dimensions; cultural, automation, lean, measurement, sharing, and learning – by small or larger organisations for achieving agility through DevOps.

      Node.js add-ons allow native code written in C and C++ to be run from the Node.js JavaScript runtime. In this talk, Athan will discuss how to utilize native add-ons for high performance numeric computing and machine learning in server-side applications. He will first provide an overview of add-ons and their associated toolchain. Next, he will provide a step-by-step example which involves compiling basic linear algebra subroutines (BLAS), a suite of libraries which are part of the core foundation of most modern numeric computing environments, as native add-ons. While Node.js add-ons are oriented toward C and C++, he will show how to extend compilation support to Fortran libraries in order to maximize computational performance. Throughout this talk, Athan will offer lessons learned, tips and tricks, and other insights gained while writing add-ons to help you maximize Node.js for your server-side applications and to demonstrate why Node.js is an excellent environment for high performance numeric computing and machine learning.

      Web development changed dramatically during the last years. With the enormous amount of JavaScript libraries and the new HTML5 standard, it is much easier to create web apps today. When building a web app, you will probably want to reuse some of the web components you built. But how can you do that with the current state of HTML? One of the new and emerging web standards is Web Components. The Web Components standard enables you to create reusable web components that include HTML, CSS and JavaScript. On the other hand, crafting raw components can be cumbersome. This is where Stencil comes into place. In this session you will become familiar with Stencil, a compiler that generates standard-compliant Web Components.

      More and more web applications using Angular today need a kind of map, either to just display their location, or visualize their data. These data can be from points/locations of services/places/etc, or a user input, to more complex visuals like heatmaps or paths. These visualizations can easily be achieved with the Google Maps JS API. However, the integration with Angular and the use of its tools is not always straightforward. In this presentation I will show examples of how to integrate Google Maps easily into your Angular application without the use of any external libraries. Part of the presentation will also show some techniques for visualising spatial data on these maps.

      As we move beyond a world of using just a handful of internal and external APIs, to a reality where we operate thousands of microservices, and depend on hundreds of 3rd party APIs, modern API infrastructure begins to look as complex as a municipal transit system. Realizing that API operations is anything but a linear life cycle, let’s begin to consider that all APIs are in transit, evolving from design to deprecation, while still also existing to move our value bits and bytes from one place to another. I would like to share with you a look at how API operations can be mapped using an API Transit map, and explored, managed, and understood through the lens of a modern, Internet enabled "transit system".

      Progressive Web Apps are the next big thing for the web. They combine the advantages of two platforms: searchability and shareability of the web with capabilities and performance of native mobile. As a result, web developers can use their favourite tools to build installable, re-engageable, connectivity independent apps, that can bring native-like performance and user experience.  The Angular Service Worker makes it easy to get started building PWA. It’s developed to automate main routines and provide us with some nice tools to control the progressive app behaviour. During this practical session, we'll have a look at NGSW’s main components, and how they take our web app to the next level. With just some simple updates we’ll get installable, offline-capable, mobile-network-friendly Angular app re-engaging users by push-notifications.

      The field of data science can appear intractable and overwhelming, often leaving newcomers at a loss for knowing where to begin. However, once you learn basic principles and workflows, you will see many opportunities where these techniques can help you in your projects. You can better understand your users, embed a recommendation engine into your application, or easily ship dashboards including statistical summaries and stunning visualizations. The rise of Node.js and Electron are powering a new era where JavaScript continues to expand beyond the browser and becomes a critical component of server and desktop applications. With JavaScript being everywhere, one of the emerging next frontiers for JavaScript world domination is data science. In this workshop, Athan Reines and Philipp Burckhardt will demonstrate how to utilize the JavaScript open-source library stdlib for various data science tasks. Through a series of brief exercises, attendees will get a hands-on introduction, ranging from machine learning to exploratory data analysis and visualization. After completing this workshop, attendees will have a solid understanding of what kind of problems they can approach by which techniques. The speakers will close by outlining future steps for data science in JavaScript and identify opportunities for community development of next-generation tools.

      The term Progressive Web App (PWA) refers to a group of technologies, such as service workers and push notifications, that can bring native-like performance and user experience to web apps. PWAs are interesting because in some ways they represent a coming of age for the web. The Angular Service Worker makes it easy to build snappy web apps that load instantly on any device, even without an internet connection. Take advantage of the searchability, shareability, and no-install-required-ability of the web without compromise. During this 100 % hands-on session we’ll have a look on recent tools and guides from the Angular team to help us build Progressive Web Apps. We’ll have a look at Angular CLI and plugins/libraries for App Shell, Service Worker, and Application Manifest supporting us in fast and easy creation of installable, offline-capable, mobile-network-friendly apps.  Course overview: Introduction to PWA and Workshop Setup; introduction to Angular Service Worker; create an installable mobile web app with Angular CLI; make the App Installable with Web App Manifest; App Shell Architecture; add an app shell component to the App; deep dive into Service Workers; add basic offline capabilities with Service Worker; adding Splash Screen; sending Push Notifications; questions and answers.
