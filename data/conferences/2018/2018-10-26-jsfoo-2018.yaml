    With JavaScript being used as much as it is talked about, JSFoo is certainly the most needed conference this year! The reasons for its popularity are also the reasons for its vulnerability (security-wise). Hence this edition will focus broadly on JavaScript and security.HasGeek hosted the first edition of JSFoo in 2011 to address the growing needs of a niche community working with Javascript. Since then, our JS community has grown tremendously. And this year, we’re meeting again on 26 – 27 October to explore new ideas and developments, to implement innovative solutions, and to learn from others’ experiences. Want to see the quality and topics of talks at last year’s conference? You can watch the JSFoo 2017 videos or the related ReactFoo 2017 videos to see what was on trend. Or check out the 2017 conference website.

      Web Application security has generally been focused aroud OWASP, and terms like XSS, CSRF and the like are generally thrown around. In this talk, the aim is to change the mind-map of how we think about and approach security, and outline a methodology that allows you to think about security in a holistic, comprehensive manner. This talk will not specifically talk about security hole A or B, but rather a mindset that we can adopt while developing applications.Shyam is the CEO of ReStok, his own startup right not, and has been a Googler, and an Amazonian in the past. He has run both his own startup and headed the engineering of large e-commerce startups as well. He has also been a Security Reviewer at Amazon and helped certify many applications before launch to ensure they adhere to the best security practices.

      There’s a lot you have to think about when building frontend applications - routing, performance, animations, etc. Security often takes the back seat (not cool!).Between cookies, tokens, keeping users authenticated, and handling resource access, security can become quite tricky. Let’s look at the implementation detail and usage of the popular methods of authorization: JWT(JSON web tokens) and see what makes it secure in the first place?

      Your brand has multiple products on the web. They all need authentication. But obviously, you’d maintain a common authentication and user database.Also, in this age, you cannot make a login system without Login with [Facebook|Google|Twitter|...]For the second thing, you need to consume Oauth2.0 (the industry standard now), for the first thing, you need to make your own Oauth server.And you want all of this to happen securely (so yeah, little to no frontend JS)This talk is nothing but my journey of building oneauthEven before we had a tech team, I knew we’d be building at least 2 very disconnected products, but having a common authentication mechanism.

      As mobile data and mobile devices become more and more accessible in India, we need to build experiences not just for the high-end users but also vary our content dynamically to cater to users with slower devices or poor network connectivity. Images being the single largest contributor to page size provide a great, yet simple, opportunity to optimize for a faster experience to all the users.Key Takeaways - Using service workers to dynamically adapt image content on a web page on the basis of network speed - Important points to consider while using this technique - An inexpensive way to achieve capabilities that are usually restricted to expensive infrastructure providers.Intended Audience - Front-end developers keen on using modern technology to deliver a faster user experience for their website’s users,Rahul is the Co-founder at ImageKit.io. He has worked in the past with PayPal and ixigo.com as a backend and a frontend/full-stack developer respectively. Currently, he mostly deals with technology-related stuff at ImageKit.io.

  - title: Architecture of scalable and resilient NodeJS apps with GraphQL & event-driven serverless

      The true power of GraphQL lies not just in its syntax but the fact that it makes it possible to reason about applications in ways we have never thought of before. The realtime bits of the GraphQL spec is one such horizons-widening abstraction when we use it as a tool to think about architecting an asynchronous, event-driven backend.Architecting the frontend of applications to consume a fundamentally async backend is still a challenge. GraphQL subscriptions and live-queries offer an opportunity to design a “reactive” contract between the backend and the frontend. In this model, an app makes a GraphQL mutation and then runs a GraphQL subscription to get updates as they happen. The business logic in serverless functions gets triggered automatically after the mutation and app gets success/error updates as and when they happen.With serverless functions, we get an auto-scalable, resilient backend which is perfect for processing asynchronous actions and stateless workloads. Such tasks include sending emails/push notifications, ETL, long running business logic etc. With no servers to provision and zero ops-tasks, it is very easy for a front-end developer to write and deploy these complex logic as functions in NodeJS etc.To draw on the Redux analogy, GraphQL mutations are actions, datastore is the “state”, asynchronous business logic are the “reducers”, and GraphQL subscriptions/live-queries become the state update glue. In this talk, I will talk about how we can use GraphQL and event-driven serverless functions to reason about the data-flow in an application.

      As developers, we are all well aware of the importance of writing tests. Whether it is the safeguard against letting silly bugs slide in production code or enforcing certain styles and practices for everyone involved in contributing to the code base, we can all agree that writing tests is an important part of the development lifecycle.And you get the idea. We went back and forth with a lot of different test strategies and a few things finally clicked and made sense. This is an attempt to share all those learnings with developers who have faced the issues mentioned above during writing or fixing tests, in the hope that these can be used as standards moving forward to save you and your team from hours of frustration.Product Engineer @Postman. Full stack web developer with a keen eye for building elegant interfaces and a proven record of writing scalable backend code. Loves everything javascript. Speaks at conferences, meetups, hackathons and generally all the time. Likes open source, startups, and people.

      Malicious Code Execution is considered to be one of the most serious security issues across any technology. This has plagued client-side JavaScript in the form of Cross-site Scripting. Though this issue has been around since the early days of the web, its variations, prevention techniques and detection mechanisms have evolved over time. This talk will cover everything a modern developer absolutely must know about on client-side malicious code execution.Lavakumar Kuppan is the founder of Ironwasp Security. He is a security researcher and a product developer. He has done extensive research on web security with special focus on JavaScript security. He has discovered several novel attacks vectors and vulnerabilities and has spoken about his research in several international conferences.He has also done extensive work on developing open source tools to discover security issues in JavaScript, through both static and dynamic analysis.

      As a developer, I’ve worked for over 9 years with dynamically typed languages, and for the past year, I’ve been learning and working with a new language called ReasonML - a statically typed functional “language” which, in reality, is a brand new syntax for OCaml. And it compiles to Javascript! I’ve been using ReasonML to build a password manager for teams, and I’d like to share a few insights that I’ve gained during the process.The gist of the talk is that while getting started with ReasonML is really simple, the true value of adopting a language like ReasonML does not lie in its obvious features. There are patterns and complex capabilities that are made possible by the strong type system that can elevate our ability, as developers, to accurately describe our intent when writing programs. It also gives tools and techniques to deal with our unfortunate tendency to make mistakes.Hari is the Engineering lead at SV.CO, and has been a professional programmer since 2009. He has worked on a variety of products using a range of programming languages, including PHP, Python, Java, Ruby, and JavaScript. He is currently building an open-source password management tool called Turaku.

      At BigBinary, we are in the process of building AceHelp with the aim to provide contexutal help docs for websites and webapps. Contextual help takes into account which page the user is on and what help doc might be most relevant for the user.We are building the frontend for AceHelp using Elm, a functional programing language to build frontend applications. In this talk, I will be giving the audiance an introduction to the language and why we chose it. I will also be talking about our journey in building a full fledged frontend application using the language.We dive into the language, exploring its syntax and more importantly its architecture. We will look at the good parts and the challenges that we faced while building a real world application through Elm.Thereby through this talk I hope to inspire the audience to explore languages like Elm to build robust frontend applications with more maintainable code and better determinism.Ritesh works as a Senior Software Developer at BigBinary.
