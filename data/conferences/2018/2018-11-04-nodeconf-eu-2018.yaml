    NodeConf EU is first and foremost about community. A community that is kind to its members, a community that values diversity. It's a gathering of minds in an informal setting. It offers attendees an opportunity to meet with their friends, peers and speakers in a relaxed, welcoming, friendly and most importantly respectful environment.

      The ES2015 revision of JavaScript introduced Promises as primitives for asynchronous operations and generators as primitives for concurrent programming. read less On top of that ES2017/18 added async functions and generators. This talk briefly explores these primitives, and dives into the performance peculiarities of Promises-based programming paradigms. We’ll especially look into how these operations perform in V8, the JavaScript engine that powers both Node.js and Chrome.

      The FaaS revolution is taking the world by storm. It just so happens that JavaScript has become the lingua franca of the FaaS revolution. read less Customers love the no-ops and ergonomics of this new paradigm. They enable a revolution in developer velocity, allowing engineers to deploy code to production much faster than before. At Netflix, these features are a perfect fit for the Netflix API Platform, which provides engineers the ability to write and deploy tier-1 services using JS without having to manage infrastructure or operations. However, there are trade-offs to consider. Most FaaS offerings today are great for latency insensitive tasks, but not for fully fledged services that need to be isolated, low latency, reliable, and elastically scalable. Learn about the architecture and internals of Netflix’s JS FaaS platform, which lets engineers deploy JS functions as isolated, reliable, and low latency production services.

      Taron Foxworth wants to translate technology for people to learn, love, and be inspired. Taron is the Lead Technical Evangelist at Losant and an adjunct professor at Xavier University. Taron was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, then relocated to Cincinnati, Ohio. Taron is currently interested in all things food and whiskey, IoT, Blockchain, Node.js, buzz words, and other really random things. I wondered, can I use JavaScript to predict if a machine will fail? With Tensorflow.js, some sensors, and a little elbow grease, this is totally possible. read less As the price of Internet-connected chips drops, it is now possible to connect anything – literally anything – to the Internet. But we're generating so much data off of these devices that we need some help making sense of it all. Enter machine learning. This talk is an introduction to machine learning – what it is (and is not!), how it is beneficial, and how you as a JS developer can start learning. We'll cover the basics of building a model and using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and use these skills to predict machine failure. JavaScript developers can use their skills to program the web, build cloud-based applications, develop games and robotics – and now, with Tensorflow.js, you can add machine learning to your repertoire.

      GraphQL is a query language that is rapidly gaining wide adoption across the community. It combines type validation with a query and filtering syntax that makes it easy to get up-and-running with a powerful web API in almost no time. read less Features like running parallel queries or update-all become much easier, because they are first class citizens of GraphQL. Add to that a vibrant community that keeps creating excellent tooling and documentation, it’s clear why GraphQL has become so popular with developers Every abstraction has a cost, and GraphQL is no exception. The added complexity and a new schema format to parse and execute mean new performance bottlenecks. In addition to performance issues, the wrong use of GraphQL can lead to architectural bottlenecks. Instead of viewing this as a problem we took this as a challenge. In this talk we’ll cover what GraphQL is, why it’s great and how we made it run a lot faster on Node.js, in fact *much* faster, using different performance techniques that we have learned in the last few years.

      CommonJS, along with the npm registry, has become the de-facto standard in Frontend and NodeJS development today. But Native ES Modules are coming to NodeJS and the browser. read less On the surface, they look incredibly similar to CommonJS modules, but the differences are important. In this talk I will describe these differences, the consequences of these differences, and how to start preparing for the new world of Native ES Modules. Why is this talk important? Because Native ES Modules _are_ coming. And everybody will be talking about them in 2019. And we need to be prepared, for it _is_ going to be a difficult transition, because the differences are subtle and they bite.

So what's this serverless nonsense and why does it matter to Node.JS? read less The answer involves a dash of microservices, a pinch of scale, and a whole lot of abstraction. Follow along as we take a quick but deep dive into the new arena of serverless architectures! Learn the why and how of serverless as we build a small app on stage.

      I will present Commons Host, a static site hosting & CDN service. It is a 100% FOSS product built with new Node.js tools at every layer: core API, edge servers, CLI tooling, frontend bundling, etc. I was fortunate to contribute to the HTTP/2 implementation in Node.js as part of this effort. read less Some of the HTTP/2 specific features include:  - Coalesced Connections: Solving the performance cost of 3rd party content in the browser.  - Server Push: Using Manifests and Cache Digests to improve resource loading in the browser.  - Shared Sessions: Proxy content efficiently using interleaved HTTP/2 streams over a shared session. Replaces the legacy HTTP/1 connection pool. The story I have to share covers both global and Asia-specific infrastructure shifts, and how I am using Node.js to build for this new environment. Server hardware moving from Intel to ARM. Leapfrogging Asian cities having wide coverage for Gbps FTTH sooner than the West. Deploying Node.js services in widely diverging socio-economic environments.

But microservice application development can seem daunting. read less How is one supposed to both write an application and also deal with those devOps-y concerns, such as fault tolerance, service-service communication, performance monitoring, tracing and more. Say hello to the Istio Service Mesh. Istio makes it easy to deal with these concerns. In this talk we will look at Istio from a developers perspective. How do we start using Istio without going down the devOps rabbit hole? How can we add things, like fault-tolerance, to our current applications, without changing our current code? And what exactly is a Mesh?
