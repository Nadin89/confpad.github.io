      Development of digital products is a complex process that involves multiple  and roles managers, designers, engineers, QA, and customers. This increases the communication overhead, slows down the process, and oftentimes results and less than ideal user experience.Design systems offer a systematic approach to the process of product creation. This approach establishes an organization-wide design language that can be backed into a UI library and the styleguide and becomes the single source of truth for the entire organization. Component libraries and living styleguides encourage reuse, promote consistency, improve team productivity, help to identify common patterns and solve similar problems only once.

      No other topic in software development probably has so much controversy as linting.With a wrong workflow linting can be really a pain and will slow you and your team down. With a proper setup, though, it can save you hours of manual work reformatting the code and reducing the code-review overhead.This talk is a quick introduction into how 🚫💩 lint-staged — a node.js library I created and maintain — can improve developer experience in historically pita field — linting.Coupled with tools that analyze and improve the code like ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier and Jest, you will witness how much difference can a small tool like this make.

      Writing declarative code for our UIs is so common that we do not even think about it. But when it comes to writing logic for managing state and side effects it requires a lot of discipline to get the same benefits. We are going to talk about how we can get help writing our business logic in a declarative manner and see what benefits it gives us.

      Managing the many user interface states of an application easily becomes complicated. We will discover how some historical and important computer science concepts – state machines and statecharts – and a functional + reactive approach can make it much easier to understand, visualize, implement, and automatically create tests for complex user interfaces and flows.

      From the very first prototype to a global site with content in multiple languages, the textual content of your app or project will be a series of compromises, some of which you wont even notice making. Localization is a ridiculously difficult problem in the general case, but in the specific you can get away with really simple solutions, especially if you understand the compromises youre making.

      I'm writing my own YAML library, because none of the existing ones allowed me to manage comments within YAML files. Apparently this is not a thing one should do. The YAML spec is larger than the XML and XML Namespaces specs combined. No one in their right mind would want to write a parser for it.But, well, here we are. Let me explain where "here" is, the route I took, and why any of this matters.

      Life can be simple again. Haven’t we built the same house, or given the same haircut over and over? 80% of mobile app development is the same old song. So why is mobile so difficult/expensive? It’s not with React Native.Let,s look at how simple it is to get started in React Native using Ignite CLI. Using Ignite, you can jump in with a popular combination of technologies, OR brew your own. Ignite is the freedom to learn and automate your mobile app.

      When React was first introduced, it was ridiculed for going against established web development best practices as we knew them. Five years later, React is the gold standard for how we create user interfaces.Along the way, we’ve discovered a new set of tools, design patterns and programming techniques. In this talk, we’ll explore how we can apply the React philosophy to software engineering problems far beyond the React ecosystem.

      This talk will examine how React changed the front end landscape as we know it. We will start by recounting the pre-React landscape, including prior art. Next, we will venture into the introduction of React, and its reception and growth.But most importantly, we will take a look at the core idea of React, and why it transcends language or rendering target and posit on what that means going forward, including what React might look like years from now.

      A case study of the app I am currently working on with my team. I will show you how we managed to set up a friendly environment with the best DX, spot bugs in early stage and deliver continuous builds to QA (just by merging the PR’s). I will also cover dropping classic state management thanks to apollo-link-state and overcoming react-native and metro-bundler limitations. You cant miss this one!

      Immer is a tiny package that allows you to work with immutable data structures with unprecedented ease. It doesnt require learning new data structures or update APIs, but instead creates a temporarily shadow tree which can be modified using the standard JavaScript APIs. The shadow tree will be used to generate your next immutable state tree. Join this talk to see how to write your reducers in a much more readable way, with half the code and without requiring additional large libraries.

      A year in, developing and using Detox in production taught us a lot. From designing its API to consuming it, testing real user scenarios to advanced mocking, we learned what makes sense when E2E testing an app and what doesn’t.In this talk, we’ll discuss how Detox works and what makes it deterministic, cover some advanced use cases and methodologies, go over new features and tease the ones that are upcoming.

      Apollo has given us freedom and happiness when it comes to managing our data coming from the server but we still had to write code and sometimes a lot of it to manage our local state? Well, what if we managed it with queries too? Sounds too awesome right? Lets learn how to do this with apollo-link-state.

      Every user’s hardware is different, and processing speed can hinder user experience on client-side rendered React applications. Server-side rendering and code-splitting can drastically improve user experience by minimizing the work that the client has to do.It’s easy to get lost in the lingo, so come learn what it all means and how to easily build universal React apps using the Next.js framework. We’ll walk through the concepts and use code examples to cement your understanding. You’ll get the most out of this session if you’re comfortable with React and ES6 syntax.

      The best way to study a new development approach is to do it in practice. But good projects built with modern technologies most often require developers with experience in these technologies. One of the options to get this is a side project. What can it be in React?Varya will show how to generate a multilingual static website using Metalsmith, React and other modern technologies and tools. For over a year, she has been using this stack to build her personal blog and it turned out to be expressive, fast and convenient. After all, it’s our beloved React.
