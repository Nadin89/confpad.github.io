      Because most users access the Web on the go, it's critical that we deliver experiences that load quickly and run smoothly, regardless of network conditions. And with service worker now supported in all modern browsers, we can leverage it as a core part of our application architecture and performance strategy.  But not all service worker implementations are created equal, and they can offer vastly different performance benefits. Every prefetch and cache decision comes with speed vs. freshness and bandwidth vs. storage trade offs. Join us to discover how to evaluate and build different service worker flows for your app, giving the best experience for your users.

In this session, you'll hear how some ecommerce companies are tackling challenges like organizational complexity, legacy code, measurement, prioritization, and more to provide better experiences to their web users and prepare for future needs and demand. You'll also learn how AMP and PWA have played a role in shaping these modern consumer journeys.

      Content Management Systems (CMS) are software platforms designed to simplify the creation and management of websites and their content. Nowadays, about 50% of websites are powered by some sort of CMS platform. In this talk, we discuss our experience moving a complex CMS (i.e. WordPress) forward along the Progressive Web Road by integrating modern capabilities (e.g. Service Worker API) and progressive technologies (e.g. AMP) into its platform and ecosystem, and how the lessons learned can be applied to other CMSes.

      Many modern JavaScript frameworks render their HTML content on the client-side assuming that every environment that is accessing their pages is as modern as they are. However, many search engines – including Google Search – do not behave exactly the same as a user’s browser.  In this session, you will learn some facts about Google Search, its rendering pipeline and the various tools which can help you diagnose the gap between what your users see versus what Google Search sees. You have built a fast & engaging website – let’s make sure it’s discoverable too.

Speaking of user experience: We’ve talked about things like jank and 60 frames per seconds for years, but some of these things remain hard to reliably achieve on the web. With a new set of web standards this is changing, and we’re super excited to introduce them to you!

      Feature Policy is a new primitive which allows developers to selectively enable, disable, and modify the behavior of certain APIs and features in the browser. It's like CSP, but for features & APIs! Teams can use new tools like Feature Policy and the Reporting API to catch errors before they grow out of control, ensure site performance stays high, keep code quality healthy, and help avoid the web's biggest footguns.

      Rendering performance is mainly a function of how much you render - too much DOM will slow your site to a crawl. Native platforms actually have the same problem, but they stay fast by promoting virtual scrolling: rendering just enough content to fill the screen and continuously updating as the user scrolls. On today’s Web, virtualization breaks basic features like links and find-in-page, but hope is in sight. We’ll take an early peek at an effort to add a first-class virtual scroller to HTML, building on an exciting new platform concept called Layered APIs.

      To achieve a truly responsive experience, developers have to execute their code in 10ms chunks. That’s nearly impossible. In this talk, we'll explore two high-level strategies: Main thread scheduling, and moving work into backgrounds threads. We’ll dive into our latest performance research on multi-threading Javascript, demystify when to utilize web workers, and dive into what it really takes to guarantee responsiveness. Finally, we'll introduce a few exciting new proposals that we'd love your feedback on.

      Architecting web apps continues to be challenging, whether it's accounting for performance, the latest and greatest platform APIs, or simply trying to figure out what part of the app should do what!  In this talk, we explore how you can architect apps for maximum flexibility, and to that end we're going to reintroduce something that's 45-years old which might, in the end, pave the way for the future of web apps.

Web packaging enables a next level of content portability that can be used to speed up content delivery or improve modes of content consumption, such as offline. Furthermore, by combining web packaging with a new primitive called Portals, we’ll show how we can take the web’s low friction trait a notch further with zero-friction user experiences.

      Houdini continues to expand the power and capabilities of CSS. Houdini exposes the parts of the CSS engine that make possible APIs like CSS Grid, Scroll Snap Points, conic gradients, et al. Extend CSS’ capabilities yourself without questionable hacks and better performance.  In this talk, we look at the overall structure of the Houdini effort and take a closer look at CSS Paint, Animation Worklets and Custom Layout API. We can get a taste of what the future holds: An ecosystem of modules that bring powerful effects from the shelf to your app.

      If the first rule of performance is "do less," the second is surely "be lazy." Using LitElement-based web components, we’ll explore the use of bleeding-edge techniques and browser APIs to spread work out so that your UI is faster to load, render and respond to user input. Topics we’ll cover include route-based dynamic module loading, async rendering, chunked rendering, IntersectionObserver, display-locking, and scheduling long-running tasks.
