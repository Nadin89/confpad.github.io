      Reflecting on 20 years building websites, Dan shares what CSS taught him. Often, it had little to do with CSS itself, but everything to do with making mistakes, teaching while you're still learning, and that everything we create on the web will eventually disappear. And that's ok.

      The web is entering a new era of design opportunities with the introduction of CSS Grid, Photoshop like effects such as filters and blend modes and importantly the increasing support for Variable Fonts. Variable fonts can offer practical and creative opportunities for web design. We can combine them with pre-existing technologies to improve our font performance, design, accessibility and usability of our websites. We can also begin to explore new and exciting creative opportunities for story telling, design and expression in ways standard fonts could never provide us. This is just the beginning of our journey to discover what we can do with variable fonts.

      CSS exists at an intersection between mental models. How do we know? Because we keep hearing the same endless debate: "Is CSS broken or awesome?" Instead, we should work on building tools for collaboration - enabling teams to communicate by creating interfaces to accommodate different mental models.

      Not a lot of people use CSS counters, especially for something which is not an ordered list, but as Roman explains, this unique set of properties can be very powerful if you'll know where to look.

      Florian goes over a set of confusingly named properties and values from the css-text-3 specification that control what happens to white spaces when laying out text, and how line breaking works. He explains the logic of the system, different ways the properties can be used to achieve various results, and looks into some of the complication caused by incomplete implementations.

      Sara gives you a crash course on SVG filters — why they are awesome, how they work, and examples of powerful effects you can create with them, in a friendly, easy-to-follow approach. Brace yourself, and get ready to set your imagination free and expand your creativity for what's possible on the Web today. When it comes to graphical effects on the Web, CSS has already come a long way in the last few years, with the introduction of CSS filters and blend modes a few years back. However, when compared to effects available in graphics editors such as Photoshop and the likes, CSS is still behind, by far. But SVG, on the other hand, is not that far behind. SVG comes with a set of filter primitives that enable you to recreate Photoshop-grade effects in the browser, using a few lines of code. While the syntax and attributes of these filters may seem intimidating and not very friendly at first, once you get a grasp of how they work, you'll have a very powerful tool in your arsenal, that allows you to push the boundaries of what is possible on the Web.
