      Web development moves fast, and as a digital team we want to deliver the best work we can as quickly as possible. But universities, like other big organisations, are slow-moving: for every big decision there’s a committee or a steering group to deal with.I‘m a Senior Front-End Developer at the University of York. Before then I worked in agencies, and the difference is vast. I’m trying to change the culture of work in our marketing team to be more agency-like, so we can deliver better projects more quickly.We create reliable and high value digital web solutions that are delivered on time and on budget:
