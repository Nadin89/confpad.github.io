      React's context API has always been labelled as experimental, but from the advent of Redux it has been used in all the most exciting react libraries. It's about to become a stabilised feature so now is the perfect time to learn the new context API. Combining the context API and render props lets gives you unprecedented power to cleanly reuse code across components. It even plays well with TypeScript and Flow. This talk will explain how context and render props work and give you some ideas of how to use them to simplify your own code.Forbes Lindsay,Forbes is a software engineer at Threads, working on React and Node.js projects. In the past, he's worked on large scale React apps at Facebook, and now runs training workshops to pass on that experience to other people. In his spare time he maintains a number of open source projects, such as Pug, Promise and Cabbie.js.

      Large applications cannot be structured the same way as small applications. Many good decisions you make for a small application suddenly become bad once it grows in code and organization size. Let me walk you through a number of challenges and good decisions for scalable applications.Oleg Isonen,Oleg is an author of JSS and an architect with a focus on scalable web front-end applications. At React Day Berlin Oleg will share the insights on building complex applications with real-world examples.

      Inconsistent UI is the enemy of developers and designers alike. And while design systems are a modern and scalable way to solve this challenge, implementing one is not as straightforward as it might seem: from getting buy-in from management to picking your tech stack, rolling it out, and releasing changes to multiple apps — there are a lot of things that can go wrong. In this talk, you'll learn how to pitch a design system to your boss, rarely discussed technical caveats and challenges, and how to set your design system up for success from the start.Monica Lent,Monica is leading the Web Team at SumUp and is based here in Berlin. Her team is building the web experience that helps hundreds of thousands of small businesses around the world get started accepting card payments and growing their businesses.

      In this talk we'll dive into the approaches and strategies needed to create a great unit test environment for your JavaScript and React applications. We'll examine what makes the perfect test, what to avoid, and how to use more complex features like mocks and spies to enable you to write tests more easily. We'll also look at some of the common pitfalls and mistakes people make that can really begin to hurt you as your test suite grows.Jack Franklin,Jack is a Frontend Engineer at Thread in London working primarily with React.

      The obsession to always move on to the latest and greatest, and the fear of missing out while working with something that's older than a few months is currently dominating the dev world. Do you have enough time to learn the latest version of your favourite library or framework? Will this leave enough time if you need to learn something new? Should you stick with what you know? Should you forget about what you are using and start learning something new? What are other front-end developers using? Should you follow the crowd? This is a problem that everyone struggles with. So many decisions to make, but Kitze will help you find the answers.Kitze,Teaching React Javascript at React Academy. Cares about open source, made and maintains sizzy.co, custom-react-scripts, and mobx-router. He had the chance to work and experiment with a variety of languages and frameworks.

      As apps begin to scale, many developers find themselves asking the question - but where does all the hard stuff go? The complicated data manipulation, the validation, the process flow of our apps. In other words, the business logic. If React is designed for the view layer, and we’re using Redux or something similar for the state, then where does the business logic go? This talk looks at the different options and tries to answer that question.Rebecca Hill,Full stack JavaScript engineer at WeTransfer, building feedback software.

      One of the crucial elements of performance is to ship relevant content to your users as soon as possible. But in modern web applications, figuring out what to ship and what to prioritize can be hard. Framework driven applications have the big disadvantage of being pretty heavy for the initial load. We will start from understanding how the browser works, then we will explain what the critical rendering path is and how we can optimize it. Expect a talk full of valuable resources and ideas that one can use to improve the performance of a modern web application, with a case study on a React powered application.Alex Moldovan,Coder, blogger and tech enthusiast in general, Alex is always eager to talk about web development, javascript and programming overall. He dedicates a lot of time to teaching others, through mentoring and coaching activities and organizing JSHeroes, the biggest JS conference in Romania.

      CSS is hard! I made a living out of it being hard but when React was introduced we had a whole new level of fighting over CSS. There are so many ways to approach it and so many tradeoffs one can do when choosing the better approach that a talk that will go over these options is more than necessary. Let's walk this road thogheter and I promise it will all be fine and you will leave with an ideia of type of styling is better for each project.
