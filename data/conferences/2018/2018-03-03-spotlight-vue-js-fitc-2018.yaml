    Join us for a full day on the popular open-source progressive framework Vue.js.  Designed to be incrementally adoptable, Vue.js is easily implementable into other projects, can be embedded into existing pages, and can also function as a web application framework. Get up to speed in only one day with Spotlight: Vue.js!

      From large enterprises to funky startups it seems like everyone working in the JS space is at least somewhat interested in Vue. There are great reasons for this as Vue brings a lot to the table. Michael will be exploring what Vue is and why we need it in the first place. He will also look at what Vue does that has developers so excited. Finally Michael will look at what it’s like to work with Vue through the lens of updating an existing app to use Vue.

      There’s an astounding amount of power packed away in Vue, despite its small size. The official guide provides a gentle learning path and the API is thorough, but new features are added all the time and it’s easy to miss small, but significant updates that could change the way you write Vue apps. Chris shares some of these features, a few undocumented APIs, and other patterns that clients and community members are consistently amazed by. It’ll be hard not to open your laptop and start coding once you see these.

      This talk will cover taking an existing Vue PWA and wrapping it as a native app – while adding custom mobile-only features (e.g. push). Alex will also touch on PWA performance, and what changes in a hybrid context. For many the hybrid/cordova build process is complicated and frustrating – getting a successful build requires dependencies and configs that are not well documented, and never mind cloning to a new machine. He’ll use the corber CLI, which integrates with your existing Ember/Vue/React PWA, adding a unified build pipeline for hybrid, on-device live reload, error checking, improved clone/plugins support and splash/icons. Most importantly, the CLI will not change your existing web only environment.

      The ability to create Vue components as small decoupled units is necessary for the organization of applications. With this, parent-child and sibling-sibling components need to interact and manage information among each other. This is where it becomes incredibly important to have appropriate state management for predictability and maintainability of your entire application. This talk will cover how to manage data between components, what ‘custom events’ are and the cons associated with using them, how to use a small global store for simple state management and finally, why Vuex is the most appropriate method for managing state for medium to large applications.
