      Training for technical diving prepares you for situations in a high pressure environment where failures are unavoidable but also highly dangerous. It means surviving in a hostile environment with limited resources where the failure of individual components can trigger deadly failure cascades. A diver who can’t understand how to do proper post-accident analysis and who hasn’t learned to repeatedly survive through failure is a liability to themselves and to others. This talk uses the framework of technical SCUBA and rebreather diving to talk about patterns for failure management and how they can be applied in an engineering context.

      In this session, we do not look at how Kubernetes is structured. Because this may and may not be the same as the user. Let's take a look at how pods roll out via deployments and automatically scale over self-generated / published metrics. Needless to say, we also configure the reverse proxy (ingress) so that our application can be reached via the Internet. We also look at how we do Canary Deployments with Kubernetes. Other buzzwords we will use are ServiceDiscovery with (Headless) Services and Storage Management.

      The Agile and DevOps movements place a lot of emphasis on the autonomy, self-organization and responsibility of teams. A common misconception is that there is little or no role for leaders of such teams. On the contrary! In this rapidly changing world, where competition is fierce and the pressure to deliver is high, effective leaders create environments that allow teams to thrive. They enable, coach and inspire. But what makes a leader an effective leader? Attend this talk to learn more about various leadership theories, how they can be applied in practice, and my thoughts on leadership based on experience as a tech lead and scrum master and from military service.

      "Whether starting a greenfield project in one of the public clouds or implementing a lift-and-shift project – cloud security always is and will be an important topic. Even more so with the “privacy by design” principle that was put in place by GDPR. There are lots of best practices out there: multi-account strategies, principle of least privilege, automated patching and scanning security vulnerabilities and enforcing encryption – just to name a few measures to harden your cloud infrastructure. Ideally all these are driven by CI/CD pipelines to enable confident changes and short cycle times. The session will cover AWS-based examples on proven best practices and solutions that can be used to harden your cloud infrastructure with little effort using the already available features and components."

      "Containers and Kubernetes are becoming the de-facto standard for software distribution, management, and operations. Development teams see and realize the power of these technologies to improve efficiencies, save time, and focus on the unique business requirements of each project. At the same time, the process of deploying, running, managing, and handling upgrades for Kubernetes is time-consuming and requires significant in-house expertise. InfoSec, infrastructure, and software operations teams, for example, face a myriad of challenges when managing a new set of tools and technologies as they integrate them into an existing enterprise infrastructure.  In this session, Oleg will outline the unique challenges organizations embarking on a containerization and Kubernetes journey must consider. In particular, he’ll focus on following critical elements: ·               Centralized monitoring and log collection ·               Security, identity and access management, audit ·               Governance and resource management ·               Backup and disaster recovery ·               Infrastructure management Oleg will also provide an overview of the general architecture of a centralized Kubernetes operations layer based on open-source components such as Prometheus, Graphana, ELK Stack, KeyCloak, etc. By breaking down each of these areas, attendees will gain a good understanding of what it takes to ensure successful container and Kubernetes ‘Day 2’ operations."

      This talk is about how to strategically think about using system data and operations to uncover the deeper story of your product, to understand what users want without asking them and without guessing. Make better use of system logs and other data to inform what we build focusing on the "learn" aspect of the build-measure-learn development cycle. Think of it as bringing a deeper connection between product roadmaps and a DevOps culture.

      "Developers love containers: they help to package applications neatly and unravel library dependencies. Some ops teams take a more sober view of the technology, though. They are responsible for the infrastructure and the security. Shared kernels separating applications only by namespaces and groups, cause raised eyebrows now and then. The level of isolation provided by real VMs was more credible, some say. Kata containers are about to overcome this gap: The project starts containers in extremely lightweight VMs but keeps the interface. All calls and integrations to Docker or Kubernetes remain the same because the project implements the OCI interface. The talk introduces to the architectural design of Kata Containers, explains the easy installation using a Docker runtime environment and shows how to use it. We present the results of the simple benchmarks and discuss differences to purely namespace-based containers. Finally, we look at improved memory consumption and some other features, that got introduced in the more recent updates of Kata Containers."

      Shell scripts have been our constant companions since the seventies and although there have been many other contenders like Perl, Python or Ruby, Shell scripts are still here, alive and kicking. With the rise of the container, writing shell scripts becomes an essential skill again, since plain shell scripts are the least common denominator for every Linux container. A lot of historical dust settled on our rusty shell scripts which makes them hard to maintain and to extend. In this hands-on session, we will see how we can polish our shell. An opinionated approach about conventions will be demonstrated for writing modular and maintainable scripts. We will learn how to write integration tests for our shell scripts. This and much more will be part of our ride through the world of Bash and co. Come and enjoy some serious shell script coding, you won’t regret it.

However, as everyone working with complex technology, we too have our ups and downs. I want to share our experience on the failure approach journey. We have come long way by applying industry best standards on blameless postmortems and implementing just culture. I will cover improvement of internal processes and go through few technical incidents with detailed analysis. Focus will be set on continuous improvement as means for avoiding same mistake to happen again or at least minimizing its impact next time in microservice hybrid-cloud environment.

      Package managers are hard. Helm learned a lot of lessons from others’ mistakes, but also repeated some. For example, having a single index file per repository is not scalable. It’s the same mistake that NPM made and it causes slower CI, high memory consumption, slower searches, and more. Another example is not having private enterprise repositories in mind, leaving out authorization and authentication features. In this talk, we’ll explore several solutions to those problems, their strengths, and their weaknesses.

      Digital economy makes applications the center of your world and the trust anchor of your customer. At the same time, your customer expects the highest comfort which makes it necessary to keep your applications up to date with new features as quick as possible. This results in several release cycles per day which need to be in sync with your security policy. To get this managed, it is necessary to get your application security infrastructure over infrastructure as code integrated in your CI/CD system. In this presentation, we will show a declarative approach to keep the integration as simple as possible together with the capability to integrate RBAC to get the domain specific knowledge of different teams like SecOps, DevOps and NetOps seamlessly integrated.

      "1. Speed – rapid iterations require agile coordination 2. Relevance – integrating market feedback requires integrated communication 3. Quality and Testing (not "testing quality”) are built into every step of the process The above is well-documented and widely accepted as part of the DevOps revolution. But we have not yet won the battle! The solution lies not in adopting new tools, which only would be little more than an improved means to an unimproved end, but in changing our concept of what a product is, how we architect it, how we build it, how we test it, and how we orchestrate its release. We need to stretch our imagination and reassess our goals to include the larger organization. Orchestrating the release of a product is not a technical exercise: it requires coordination between many people and groups within in the organization and the right people need to be involved. None need to be more committed to the transformation than middle-level managers, architects, and team leads."

      The purpose of the talk is to motivate teams to take a moment and reflect on their Continuous Delivery pipeline architecture for the sole purpose of improvement and encourage them to KISS "Keep it simple, (maybe not stupid)" their continuous delivery architecture all the way. The architecture of continuous delivery pipelines is becoming complicated and complex everyday, I will go on and add that sometimes the continuous delivery pipeline architecture of a product ends up being more complicated and resource intensive than the actual product. In this session I intend to highlight the different reasons that may be contributing to the over complexity of continuous delivery pipeline architectures and eventually also talk about different ways to adopt to keep the architecture simple and manageable in the long run.

      "In the course of digital transformation, many business processes are currently undergoing fundamental change. Management wants the cloud in order to better face cost and competitive pressure. There is hardly a company that does not start strategic cloud initiatives. According to independent market research, by 2020 more computing power will be used as a IaaS than in traditional on-premise infrastructures. No Cloud will be as rare as No Internet. Apart from all the advantages such as agility, costs, and efficiency as well as automation, hybrid architectures also entail various challenges:  – Multiple environments – too many tools – Operational Challenges – lack of skills and professionals – Advanced threats – Compliance requirements in increasingly regulated markets Modern infrastructures can perfectly balance cloud and on-premise parts for every requirement. Learn how to leverage the value of cloud infrastructures while addressing challenges."

      "How to apply DevOps in a traditional and large enterprise is a hot topic. Terms like digitization and transformation are now common buzzwords among management, thus defining a technology roadmap and reinventing your business with software is a must if you want to excel or even survive. It is clear that today, no company can’t compete without technology, the question is: how do we use that technology efficiently? For years, the community has given answers to the growing and demanding IT requirements: Agile methodologies are there since the early 2000s, as a result, in the last 10 years a DevOps culture has been developed, and there are multiple successful stories that prove its value. Nonetheless, often stakeholders are very disappointed about how IT works in their companies: software often fails, misses deadlines, is expensive, unmaintainable and tech trends change rapidly. Even if state of the art technologies are applied and enable such transformations, there is still a long road ahead to achieve such DevOps culture. At MindDoc, we have the ambitious challenge of transforming traditional healthcare services with software solutions that improve the delivery of care to our patients. At first glance, nothing differs from any other business who wants to transform. However, there are many ways in which you can approach digitization in a traditional enterprise, often with a strong focus on outsourcing. Instead, we follow a "digital unit" approach, which puts an emphasis on organizational independence, in-house development, and fewer communication dependencies. Getting the best of a startup and a big company is mainly the goal of such approach, with plenty of challenges and tough decisions. As a result, we present the chronology of how is the internal development of an online therapy platform in one year, from zero to a product that can be constantly shaped based on the needs of our patients and therapists. Challenges like recruitment, old IT interfacing, keep solving problems with code, cross-functional communication, scaling Agile teams, process compliance, security, what to outsource… are still there, and a digital unit approach gives the flexibility needed to provide solutions for them."

      If you want to be in nowadays, you count on open source software (OSS) to stay flexible and avoid reinventing the wheel. Many applications contain more open source code than proprietary code. Using components with known vulnerabilities is one of the most common OWASP risks. In this presentation, we will look at the security, operational and legal challenges associated with the use of third-party components which are mostly open source. Next, we discuss how these risks can be addressed using various make-it-yourself or buy-it approaches so that you can stay atop of the OSS flood.

      Applications today are deployed in fully automatic environments like microservices, containers or clouds, which allow seamless load balancing, auto-scaling and other infrastructure-dependent services. To secure such applications many different security policies need to be applied, like SSL/TLS, ACLs, IP Reputation, WAF and more. This talk will look at the challenges and solutions how to integrate a modern WAF into an application development pipeline and how to create processes that support both security and development requirements. We will share a reference implementation and present a demo environment where we implemented these processes.

      "Gene Kim articulates: “The Third Way (of DevOps) is about creating a culture that fosters two things: continual experimentation, taking risks and learning from failure; and understanding that repetition and practice is the prerequisite to mastery.” Yet, as DevOps is getting popular traction, what we experience are misinterpretations (the DevOps team or DevOps Person), land-grabs by methods sellers or asking big consultancies to roll it out, instead of trusting seasoned and experienced practitioners. They’re changing work environments and relocate people routinely into new teams or locations. Solutions are all about reengineering work flows, not about meeting workers’ needs. We’re replacing old constraints with new ones and the transformation grinds to a halt. The Third Way asks us to reflect on our beliefs and go off piste to look for ideas to improve. We do little to understand the social impact when we aim to transform our organisation. We ask the organisation to adapt towards our engineering excellence and resist to adapt ourselves to the needs of the organisation. How do we gain situational awareness of the social network in which we do work and how does it help DevOps? I will present experiences applying these ideas."

      "Distributed applications like microservices shift some of their complexities into the interaction of services. Such a service mesh, which can have hundreds of runtime instances, is very difficult to manage. You will be concerned with some of the following questions: • which service will be requested by which other services in which version and how often depending on the request content? • how can you test the interaction and how can you replace single services with new ones? These and other questions will be discussed in this session. Tools to make your live easier with a service mesh will also be introduced."

Despite this complexity, it remains a fact of life in software development and operations, one which can become easy to ignore, due to our daily interactions with and familiarity of that system (and, let’s face it, as a good strategy to cope with it). When those systems falter or fail, we often find in the postmortems and retrospectives afterward that there were "weak signals" that portended doom, but we didn’t know they were there or how to sense them. In this talk, we’ll look at what decades of research in the safety sciences has to say about humans interacting with and operating complex socio-technical systems, including what air craft carriers have to do with Internet infrastructure operations, how resilience engineering can help us, and the use of heuristics in incident response. All of these provide insight into ways we can improve one the most advanced — and most effective — monitoring tools we have available to keep those systems running: ourselves."

      We look at how authentication works in and on Kubernetes. After a small excursion into the world of TLS certificates in which we create a user using OpenSSL, we turn to the possibility to authenticate users via OpenID-Connect. This allows us to authenticate users, e.g. Google, Gitlab or your own Keycloak instance. Right now I tend to Keycloak. The connection to an AD / LDAP is e.g. possible via Dex. Although this is briefly explained but not demonstrated.

      In the last three years we have built the infrastructure of the television platform waipu.tv. We started writing tools for the operation in Golang. Some of the tools turned into core services that easily take away the burden of a FIFA World Cup broadcast. We want to show you how to use the same tool chain (Golang & Co) to solve operational problems and develop critical business applications. Classic DevOps or Golden Hammer?

      "Go is not a language traditionally used in SysOps. However, as SysOps transforms to DevOps and systems complexity keeps increasing, the need for scalability is increasing as well. Scalable system need generalized support, less scripting and more software development, ideally using a cross-platform language that supports concurrency and parallelism. This is a great time to refresh the toolbox. Looking at recent observability and operations tools, many are written in Go: Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, CoreOS, Istio, Grafana, Jaeger, Moby, etc.  Why Go? In this talk we will talk about the language, when its use makes sense and what features make it a good choice, e.g. type safety, clear syntax designed for concurrency, built-in support for parallelism, and the built-in cross platform and cross architecture support that doesn’t require dependencies management.

That is, teams struggle with how to handle the constant onslaught of overwhelming amounts of work and begin to lose hope. The good news is that if you understand operating systems, you already know a great deal about how to tame the chaos! Process management is an integral part of an operating system. The OS makes decisions about scheduling, sharing information between jobs, handling interrupts and multi-tasking. It also has to manage the resources of a process and be concerned with process synchronization, just as we mere humans do. This presentation will show you how to apply common concepts from operating system process management to the way teams process work. Learn how to help your team kick CDD to the curb!"

In this use case, I’ll lay out Shopping24’s move into the Amazon AWS cloud a few years back and our recent journey back into a classic datacenter. Myths about pricing, noisy neighbors and machine sizing will get busted (or approved). The bottom line for doing effective DevOps in both classic and cloud infrastructure is automatization. I’ll explain how this can be achieved with the right toolset (Ansible) and the modern server chassis and how Kubernetes came to the rescue."

But for as much as we all talk about them, in many organizations and teams, the outcome of continual organizational learning and improvement remains elusive. Why is this? In this talk, we’ll look at five "dirty words"* that are often thrown around during postmortems, retrospectives, and other learning exercises that not only make it difficult for teams to discuss learning, but promote activities and behaviors that are actually counterproductive to continuous improvement. We’ll dig into the existing research on why this is – it turns out we’re not the only industry struggling with this! – and look at some different language we can start using that can more ably facilitate sustainable Continuous Improvement in our work environments. *Not actually dirty words."

      Modern software development is increasingly taking a “microservice” approach that has resulted in an explosion of complexity at the network level. We have more applications running distributed across different datacenters. Distributed tracing, events, and metrics are essential for observing and understanding modern microservice architectures. This talk is a deep dive on how to monitor your distributed system. You will get tools, methodologies, and experiences that will help you to realize what your applications expose and how to get value out from all these information. Gianluca Arbezzano, SRE at InfluxData will share how to monitor a distributed system, how to switch from a more traditional monitoring approach to observability. Stay focused on the server’s role and not on the hostname because it’s not really important anymore, our servers or containers are fast moving part and it’s easy to detach it from the right in case of trouble than call the server by name as a cute puppet. How to design a SLO for your core services and now to iterate on them. Instrument your services with tracing using tools like Zipkin or Jaeger to measure latency between in your network.

In this talk, we are presenting our approach to Kubernetes provisioning on AWS, operations and developer experience for our growing Zalando developer base. We will walk you through our horror stories of operating 80+ clusters and share the insights we gained from incidents, failures, user reports and general observations. Most of our learnings apply to other Kubernetes infrastructures (EKS, GKE, ..) as well. This talk strives to reduce the audience’s unknown unknowns about running Kubernetes in production.

      Tool-supported quality assurance has been part of software development since the very beginning and thanks to the idea of release pipelines, there is now a "natural" starting point for it. But what kind of quality control should be attached to which pipeline stage and is the pipeline the right place for this at all? The presentation shows which areas can currently be checked by tools, from security over license compatibility to architecture analysis. It also highlights where automated quality control has failed in the past and what we can learn from these failures, for example regarding the duration of a practicable feedback loop.

From a different perspective things make perfect sense – all of a sudden. Perspectives that are usual in companies but can blur the view and make things look stupid can be the following: a view from higher up the ladder, further down (vertical) or form a different silo (horizontal). A horizontal change in perspective can makes things appear wrong. A vertical shift may make things look too detailed (from higher up) or irrelevant (from lower down). In his talk, Markus will explain these phenomena and how they can lead to dysfunctional organizations, and gives examples of ways that helped him and companies he worked with to deal with them."

      Everybody is enthusiastic about the “cloud”, but how do I can transfer my old rusty application to this shiny new world? This presentation describes the migration process of a ten-year-old web application to a Kubernetes based platform. The app is written in Java with Wicket 1.4 as the Web framework of choice, running on a plain Jetty 6 servlet engine with Mysql 5.0 as backend. Step by step we will migrate this application to Docker containers, eventually running on a self-provisioned Kubernetes cluster in the cloud. We will hit some stumbling blocks, but still, we will see how this migration could be performed relatively effortless. In the end, we have learned, that “containerisation” does not only make sense for green-field projects but also for older applications to pimp up their legacy.

      The ever-increasing complexity of modern systems, modern DevOps and continuous delivery-centric workflows place new demands on performance and reliability testing approaches. When systems are comprised of many distributed components, each with its own performance and reliability characteristics, and when a misconfiguration that causes a cascading failure under load can be automatically deployed across environments all the way from dev to production in a matter of hours, you really need to make sure that a rigorous, well-understood, and easy-to-follow performance testing process is in place. In this talk, we will look at how an effective performance testing process can be implemented from the ground up (using the open-source Artillery.io toolkit) to be an integral part of an organization’s continuous delivery pipeline. This talk is for developers, QAs, and engineering managers who are working on a greenfield project with high performance and reliability requirements or working on production systems which are experiencing issues when under load.

It’s an endless open toolkit. That is why we have started github/opendevstack, with the goal that developers can focus on features and not on getting CI/CD to work. This session introduces the why and shows how opendevstack works – from provisioniong to run in less than 3 minutes, based on Jenkins, sonarqube and other usefull CI components.

We’ll look at what it brings to the table, when it may be a good fit and how it compares to the other two approaches in terms of code organization, productivity, scalability and much more. We’ll look at how this can be designed and implemented in practice. Get ready. We won’t shy away from the hard questions."
