    JSConf is coming to Iceland, again! This time, the conference takes place on March 1-2, 2018. That’s from Thursday through Friday. Perfect for catching up on talks, and with friends from the JavaScript community.Those two days will be jam-packed. Expect two tracks of inspiring, motivational and educational talks, from over 30 speakers from around the world. The speaker selection will comprise curated speakers and audience volunteers. The curated speakers submit proposals and make it through the selection process, whereas the audience volunteer speakers are “first-come, first-speak“.

      Node.js has been around for 9 years now, so you might think we’re getting closer to holding a finished piece of software in our hands. Yet somehow, despite placing a high value on stability, it is seeing a record number of commits and new contributors.

      As the number of possible states in your app grows, developing UIs can become exponentially more complex. With the help of finite automata, or finite state machines (FSMs), you will be able to manage your app's states in a simple, robust way, and even visualize them! In this session, we will discover how FSMs and statecharts can take your UIs to the next level, with innovative techniques for implementing, testing, and visualizing your app's finite states in a robust, automated way, with plenty of use cases, demos, and resources.

      Testing our JavaScript apps has come a long way. For years we relied on Selenium Webdriver to automate browser testing from outside the browser. Now we can use tools like Cypress to interact from the same JavaScript runtime as our app, without relying on remote APIs, language bindings, or browser-specific drivers.

But with AR's history dating back to 1968, why has it suddenly become the next big thing? This talk will dive into the rich history of AR to help us understand and appreciate where the technology is now. You will learn some tools to build with AR today, and understand how the technology will open up creative possibilities for our future

      It’s no secret that most people don’t read technical documentation for pleasure. Users often come to your docs when they are frustrated with your software, disappointed that they haven't been able to solve the problem on their own and generally feeling pretty low. This is a little sad, yeah, but being aware of these feelings is key for developers and technical writers. These emotions frame the reader’s perspective and therefore, should shape the mood of our docs. After all, when you've been stuck on a bug for hours, do you really want to read something saying 'but this is so easy'? In this talk, we’ll discuss how the language we use affects our users and the first steps towards writing accessible, approachable and use case-driven documentation.

      Can you write a program to create art? Code can create procedural content for games, but it can also create 3D printable objects, patterns for fabric, or Twitterbots that post code-created comic strips. Kate has produced all of these and more (and is known for outreach and education about generativity) and will demonstrate practical techniques behind generating emergent surprising and artistic worlds with Javascript, Canvas, and SVG.

It turns out that an application built with this rigor can also provide a better online user experience, by applying and tracking changes optimistically yet deterministically.

      In 2017, Airbnb supported 27 languages and had developed robust translation tools that made it easy to add more. We launched Croatian in May with little overhead beyond setting up the new domain and translating phrases. However, this was not true for all new languages; our next most requested language, Hebrew, posed a unique challenge. Because it reads right-to-left, the entire Hebrew UI must be flipped. Browsers only handle reversing the DOM structure, but styling and interactions must be coded manually.

      In 98’ I made my first webpage, which leveraged JavaScript to annoy visitors with blinking text animations. In 2017 I developed a film entirely in JS, which debuted in the Tribeca Film Festival. You can do so much with the browser today: Procedural art, interactive VR, physical simulation, real-time multiplayer games - and that’s just the tip of the iceberg. In this talk I want to take you a step further beyond sites and Web Apps. Perhaps your next project could push the envelope of the web as we know it?

      Reviewing a pull request can feel like a chore. If done poorly, PR reviews can mean a few hours of attempting to understand both the problem and the solution, then checking that the result matches the design. Sure, many of us have the luxury of walking to our coworker’s desk and getting a walk through. But what if the other dev isn’t free? What if they live in another time zone? What if you need a project manager or designer to look at your work, and they don’t have a local setup or much dev experience?

      We have been using Node as our primary web serving layer for the last 3 years at Flipkart, continuously adding more features, more properties and most importantly, more traffic onto it. This has led to the discovery of a lot of bottlenecks and a lot of late-night load tests. In this talk, I’ll be focusing on scaling a Node based web server and what kind of issues we have run into. This will include different approaches to attacking this problem like horizontal and vertical scaling. I will be taking you through the variety of resource bottlenecks you can expect to run into, like network, memory, disk and cpu. I’ll touch upon how to find these bottlenecks and what technologies you can use to solve them.

As a community, the single most damaging thing we can do is perpetuate the stigma against mental disorders. This talk will begin with an overview of key statistics about mental wellness, followed by the efforts of the non-profit organization Open Sourcing Mental Illness to gather more data about mental health in the tech industry, and conclude with the bulk of the talk focusing on ideas and strategies for making our tech workplaces more accommodating and inclusive.

      The life we live online increasingly informs the way we live offline as well. Businesses live and die through algorithms like SEO, humans are sorted in government systems, and we make large, life-governing decisions through what is shown to us on the web: home buying, where to live, what to eat, and who we're in contact with regularly. The first shift we as web developers saw was people living and learning on the web more and more, which excited us. But as we start to automate those tasks through machine learning algorithms, a lot of us have trepidation. We know systems have flaws, what are the political and social consequences?
